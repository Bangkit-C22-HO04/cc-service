The daily cleaning service was rather poor. Didn't clean the room properly. Founds bits of dirt and also found cutlery plastic from the night before under our blanket. The terrace area wasn't cleaned properly. There was an ant infestation at the terrace. On the plus side, the room was spacious, Staff did their best to try and accommodate us after some negotiations. Service recovery wasn't the best. But they did try and I'll give them that. Also, the security staff at the lobby were very friendly and professional. Room service food options were very limited and largely disappointing. I thought about being part of the Melia group. They would have had a good breakfast spread and variety but that wasn't the case.

So good time for myself who love have early breakfast with some variations of it. For myself who love veggie. It’s not good enough because they don’t have vegetables salad so I can’t get my best feeling for breakfast. Although they have a lot of things but it’s just not good enough. They could thinking about the variant menu with vegetables. It’s really important specially for people like me who love western lifestyle. We don’t like have breakfast with a lot of fat. We love healthy meals for starting our day. - One biggest problem for my second breakfast here. They give me old pepper powder when I have my omelets. I was shocked to see little baby insects on top of my meals. I already tell to the staff and they change it but my mood was worse on that day. I can’t really enjoying the meals after because I saw the animals on my meals.

Finally it was time for us to check in, January 3 at 8.30 PM (night), the check in process was normal, and the receptionist gave us the room key at 10 floor which we then knew was the floor for the smoking room. When the door opened, wow the smell cigarette smoke was so oppressive from the room, and at the end of bed and pillow we found 2 strands of hair. Instantly we called the reception to ask for rooms transfer to a non smoking rooms as our initial request when making a room booking. From the reception we got an answer that a non smoking room was not available for January 3, there was a debate because we felt that we had made a booking in advance for a non smoking room request, but were not available with an answer from the manager that other guests had booked in advance also (lied answer). The solution is to upgrade 1 paid non smoking room because in our group there's toddlers age 1,5 year. And for 2 others smoking rooms will be sprayed with ozone and air freshener. We also asking questions for the ozone 'is the ozone can eliminate toxins from the cigarette smoke that clings in the room, on the sheets and pillows? and he said could (oh my goodness). For the Hotel Managers/Employee please be understand that the request for the non smoking room is not solely because guests are not pleased with the smell of cigarette smoke, but it will be others reasons behind that. For my family group, they are 3 people who have asthma, and they will suffer more if they are in the smoking room or smell of cigarette, and also one of family member even suffered from Lung spots, and could she could pass out if his body could not tolerate the smell of cigarette and the like. After we check out we would like to say thanks you to the arrogant hotel manager Alana, because of him we visit to the doctor, especially for those who have asthma and lung spots. Based on this case, we as guests urge website as applicator and together with hotel to make a Mandatory clause for non smoking/smoking room, not as subject to be discuss, because health is the right of everyone not to be placed in a bargaining position/subject to be discuss. On the second day, at the end, the others of 2 smoking rooms can be move to non smocking room, and we just found out from the employee on duty that our non smoking room was originally available and has been designated for us, but because guests extend on the spot, then the hotel chose to give the room to them (Congratulation Manager, you're the rock).",Family vacation

We traveled with two toddlers. I mentioned that we will need a baby crib in the reservation and we never get it even until the second day. Breakfast was amazing, having a lot of varieties and tasty. But, while we have breakfast, it was very difficult to find the baby chair. The staff said that all baby chairs are occupied then my husband was going around all the hall and found out there are only 2 baby chairs that were using. I wonder if that big 5-star hotel only have two baby chairs. That is so disappointing. And then while we were swimming, the staff asked my husband to get out from the pool. He said my husband needed to wear a swimsuit which for me it was very clear that he wore that. But the staff said that it supposed to be made from parachutes material. It was very ridiculous for us. We've never been asked to get out from the pool for using swimming pants that made from cotton pants. In addition of that, my husband was only at the kids pool watching for my kids. So we thought that it was really rude. Overall, we found out that this place was not convenient for traveling with kids and that the staff's attitude needs to be improved.",Family vacation

We love the greeting from the concierge, the security guard, but when it comes to front desk it was very dissapoited. When I checked in, I told the front desk guy name, eko that I need to go to restroom while he is busy arranging 2 connecting rooms for us. When I back to eko, he is actually helping other client and asked me to wait. I am a bit irritated but I can still hold my anger. After he is done with this client, he told me to wait again and I said ok. While waiting, I told eko I will get some refreshment on the side. After I came back, you know what happened?? He is taking care other client which is foreigner and ask me to wait again. I told him right away that its so impolite to ask someone to wait while you keep servicing other customers. You can feel the vibe of the frnt desk team that they love foreigner more than local. From the greeting of the front desk, you can tell their are more welcome to foreigner. Please fix it tentrem hotel. We are you guest as well! We pay money to stay in this hotel. Fyi, the first time I check in, I even give my id and credit card so he can get everything done quicker.

We then asked for another room. Our new room (228) was better but the AC wasn't cool enough. It was noticeably warmer than the lobby or even the hallway. A technician came twice to fix it and it got a little bit better. Later we found the reading light and master light switch didn’t work also so the lights can either be all switch on or off. It was annoying but didn’t want to waste our time to complain again and move again to another room.

103011084,409746,Onggutomo,6.4,"For A Five Star Hotel according to my opinion this hotel still far from it. The Hotel Interior was great, It's a modern architect and feels like a 5 star hotel but their staff still need to learn how to run a 5 star hotel. When I was arrived the staff (Bell Boy) were friendly but they were not too attentive like trying to take all the bags for the guest and they didn't even greet you (only some of the staff did greet the guest). When I checked in, the staff were nice and friendly. But the Hotel Reservation didn't give me the room that I reserved. I reserved for 1 king size bed, instead they gave me 2 Bed (I only travel alone). I complained about this, but the receptionist said She can't do anything since the hotel was fully booked, and only a suite was available. I was complaining too many beds but she was trying to give me bigger rooms. For a 5 star hotel, This is really unacceptable. And in the Lift they're using touch screen for choosing the floor but somehow it was very hard to touch like a touch screen TV on a plane (very hard to operate because the screen either too sensitive or too insensitive). Anyway, the Room interior and cleanliness was great. The ambiance was great. But The Noise from next door and above floor can be heard so clear. I thought we can hear the conversation from next door, but fortunately the speech couldn't be heard. And I had to contact the Service Center/ Guest Center to complain about the room. Started from Air con it was not cold, and came an engineer. It was because the filter very dirty, so the maintenance was not in regular term. And the TV was using IPTV, had to call several times to the Guest Center, because the TV kept restarting and the decoder Box making loud noise. So many trouble for 2 night stays, without any proper apologize and any compliment. Usually, in other 5 star hotel they will try to offer you their apologize in some compliment if the guest had too many problems in the rooms. Overall, I think this Hotel is nice and good, especially the breakfast. They had so many option for the foods and the taste was great. But They need to trained the staff to be more attentive and try to take care of their reputation as a 5 star hotel.",Shopping & Culinary

126334476,100215,Budi W.,6.3,"First, it's so sad that you only had awesome and unsatisfying for the answer, Please add one more, moderate/so-so. So it can accommodate my experience in the right category. First of All, I am happy with Hyatt Yogyakarta property. It has all the facility, where when I decided not to go outside of the hotel at all, Hyatt Yogyakarta is the best place. And having Kopi and Susu in the premises is so adorable. The Check In Process was flawless and the gate keeper and bell boy are great. However, for 5 stars hotel and with Hyatt name some of below does not meet the expectation: 1. The lobby, elevator, restaurants are meeting the expectation. But not the room: a. The Bed room, the bed it's really doesn't feel like 5 stars hotel resort. It does look so old. The bed are hard, the pillow were deflated, the blanket does not hug you or keeping you warm. B. The Cupboard door are ready to fall off, the Wardrobe door won't kept shut. C. The walls and doors are so thin, I can hear the kid sound morning, day and night. D. The room next door was being fixed like at noon when we decided to stay in and rest, and woken up because of the knocking on room 548/549. Without warning or notification towards us. E. There were a leakage in the bathroom, which should have been mend or check before we check in. 2. Communication/Response towards us (Guest) a. Your Room Service attendance was so in a hurry to end the call, and they don't even make sure what does that means when I raised a concern about a dessert I wanted to order. So, on the last night, I ordered Tiramisu to be delivered to my room. And I asked whether it has fruit sauce on it, and when she said no-I said good, because I have fruit allergy. The food came and it has Orange and Strawberry/Raspberry sauce all over it and a big strawberry on top of it. So, I called back and asked why there are still fruit sauce on my dessert, while she literally said there are none? Why didn't she asked me why it became a concern? So, I told her-next time please make sure not to end the call so fast and make sure she note on the concerned I raised. She then (impolitely said)""Seriously, I can replace the food now"". As if implying that I only after for free food. No, I didn't asked it to be replaced-as luckily I can wipe off all the fruit sauce and throw away the strawberry. B. The coordination for bell boy to come take almost 45 minutes when we were about to check out, and it ' s not during check out time. C. When I asked if there are other provider than BUMAME that could come to the room for covid test because the time 08:00-12:00 doesn't work. The reception keep insisting for BUMAME that only available 08:00-12:00. It doesn't work with my flight plan I have explained, they just doesn't seems like to listen. D. The salt on the table on the S&P shaker are all wet, so every time I try to get it out. It won't came out. I ask for the waiter to get me a new one, after 3 times-I ask him just to bring me a small bowl of salt. Instead of coming with it, the waiter give me a toothpick and ask me to poke the whole and shake it. Where that also not successful. I mean when the solution clearly doesn't work and they will not have time to do it for us, please don't make us doing extra work to do it as well. I then open the bottom whole and pour out the salt to plate. 3. There are not enough variation on the Buffet Breakfast, we stay there for 4 days/3 nights and there where always the same dishes there every day. Hope Hyatt can still keep up with their reputation and get better on the above concern during my stay.",Holiday

But, as a 5 star rated hotel, seems we don’t have much option for the food while breakfast. And also the amenities, I didn’t see any comb which I believe the 5 star hotel should provide. Drinking water as compliment also need to be upgraded to 2 x 600 mL as it only provided 2 x 330 mL. Is it too expensive? Remember, I stay in the Deluxe room which supposed to be more complete compare to any other superior room. Related to the breakfast for children, as far I stayed in 5 star hotel anywhere, breakfast for children is free. So the packages I got supposed to be included breakfast for 2 kids. At first day, I paid additional 85K IDR per kids above 3 yrs old which I paid for 2 kids. The taste of the food not too special here. Even they served Gudeg as traditional food of Yogyakarta, but the taste was underrated. And other taste of the food was also not too special. As 5 star hotel, the management should think to provide kids corner. Many hotel, even 4 star, had provided the kids corner for their facility. One of the greatest here is the hotel landscape inside.

Is that polite by talking like that to your guests? Come on, you have no any sympathy at all!

And management always say that it wouldn't happen because they have so much award certificate, which in my opinion is not suitable for this hotel to receive such a prestigious award like that.

107762475,289515,teguh,6.1,"We stayed here on our last day in Jogja. The parking lot was quite spacious (maybe because it's not weekend so it's not too crowded). The access to lobby is so strict (using x-ray and metal detector). When we asked for late check-out, the reception only gave us 1 hour (and he refused to let me see the duty manager as stated on the check-in form if we need to request late check-out). The room was a little old but clean. They patched some part of the wallpaper, so it's not too good to see. The towels looked a little worn out (this is really a shame for a 5-star hotel), and for the mini bar : don't forget to check the list and match it with what inside the fridge (because in the list they said they have 2 cans of bintang but I only can find 1, so I reported it ASAP). The pool was not too clean because the wind bring leaves and some dust to the water, and the kids playground also not too clean because it's an outdoor playground afterall. The breakfast was not too good... there are plenty of food varieties, but I think the taste must be improved. Some of the food are still cold (ex. : siomay and sausage). The service was pretty bad... our table didn't get any fork, spoon, and napkin, but no one attended our table to check, so I have to call the waiter (standing on the table right beside me, busy placing fork and spoon on an empty table) to get our tablewares (and still no napkin). No one offer us tea or coffee like usual 4-5 star hotels. And lastly, no one bothers to check our table when the pile of plates is getting taller and taller (even when the waiter came to serve the omelette and pasta, they didn't care of the pile). And the worst case is that we have to pay 80k for a 5-years-old girl's breakfast! (they charged breakfast for child over 4 years old). This not-so-good 5-star hotel also let people to smoke IN the lobby near the reception!!! Surely this is the worst 5-star hotel I have ever stayed in! Would not recommend this hotel to anyone I know. The positive side : the location is just beside Ambarrukmo Plaza, and not far from the airport. That's all",Family vacation

But the thing that amazes me the most is the food selection at the restaurant. They offer so many options! Oftentimes I find myself confused what to eat due to wide range of choice, be it traditional Javanese cuisine, sweets, noodles, pastry… you name it. The hotel has it all. To add the cherry on top, you can see live gamelan performance while you eat your breakfast. I’ve been a customer since early 90’s (when the name was still Ambarrukmo Palace Hotel) — and they went through major renovation and closed for some times, then they bounce back even better now.

Public can knock our room even when they don't have card room (card room is not access card!). 2. The light in my first room was very dimmed and sometimes it turned off automatically then turned on again (how scary is that?). 3. The furniture are all old and misplaced. The AC remote is stationed right besides the bed with only 4 options: Off, low, medium, high. And you turned it by rotate (this is a very old AC remote; might be in 90's). 4. The bathroom has an old style Jacuzzi but every time i took a bath the water drained very slowly. Can you imagine that your ankle is submerged with the dirty water while you take a bath since it drained very slow? 5. I have a reservation for 4 days, but in the day 2; my room card cannot open the room. So i need to go to down floor again so they can fix it. And it happens again in the day 4. What the hotel has been doing? Cant they read a reservation date and make the card aligned with the date? 6. The shower equipment and some carpet in the bathroom are very dirty. One time, the shower head is detached from the shower body, and i can take a look inside of it. very rusty, dirty and got some moss on it. Imagine water goes through that and showered your body. It will not clean your body. If i could give a point. a Positive point is too good, a negative should be!!! I should take some pictures to give more feel about the hotel.

When we asked the security guards, they told us that some cars just left the hotel when definitely no car went out. This happened five times since we went in and out of the hotel. Our complaint to the management was left unanswered (and so was our second complaint). The restaurant was almost always overcrowded during breakfast and finding a place to sit was hard. The hotel layout was not good and navigating between floors and buildings was difficult. Front office staffs were unfriendly. For a 500-room hotel, it was very uncomfortable. Our rooms were dark and the linens were not clean. Plus we spend a good sum of money just to stay there. The experience wasn't pleasant and we definitely won't return to stay again.",Family vacation

So, I had to use my own mobile phone to call the receptionist or room service. They offered to send their engineer to come to our room to fix the phone. But it was late at night, and it's the pandemic time! Why would we allow a stranger to come into our bedroom at night during a pandemic? They should have fixed it before we checked in. Then, the WiFi did not work at all. I called the receptionist again (with my mobile phone) to ask for help, they referred to an IT person (on the phone), but it did not resolve. I had to use the tethering of my mobile phone to work with my laptop. They offered to come to my room to help with my laptop, but we refused. It's the pandemic time! Then, the next morning when we were about to have breakfast, we went to take an elevator on the 10th floor and found a smoking smell very strongly in the area near the elevators (despite my face mask). There were two hotel staff standing nearby the elevator, and I asked why the smoking smell. One of them said that it is allowed to smoke in the bedroom if you request it!!! And the 10th floor is a non-smoking floor!! There were non-smoking stickers in several areas on the 10th floor. What a joke! The location of the entrance is also very difficult to find.

We reserve 2 rooms with connecting door, since we brought our baby. The room is comfy with large window facing the mountain though bathroom and wallpaper need more proper maintenance. It has great infinity pool, the reason we choose this hotel among the rest of similar hotel. When we checked in the reception said thr pool it is open from 6am to 9pm, and no one said anything else. No prior announcement at the website suddenly there's notification letter in our room that the pool is closed on Sunday from 6am-1pm due to wedding events. My oh my, instead of having our baby swim at the pool, we have a crying baby that's so boring to be in the room all day. Pool is one of their public facilities, and since this hotel hace no garden, what else could they offer to the guest? If they want to sell wedding facilities including the pool, so be wise to put announcement on the website. Major disappointment, moreover when we contact the manager about the complaint, he said no compensation due to this inconvenience. Yes, easy to say.

Also, I've been to semeja to have a cup of coffee several months ago. So yes, I've been craving to stay here and I got my expectation so high. When I did the check in, the receptionist gave me the room card. I waited for other info related to where the lift was, when the breakfast time will be and so on but nothing. She just gave me the room card and that’s it. I walked and tried to find the lift to go to my room. I kept wondering because as far as I know, when we’re going to stay in a hotel, they normally will show us which way we should go (the lift, which floor, directions) and explaining the breakfast time without us asking. I thought they’d be friendly because they were friendly to guests before me and he’s a foreigner. Is that so? You base your service according to whom the person is staying? If so, then I am disappointed. I think you would treat everybody staying there the same way. Isn’t that what hospitality must do? I didn’t feel quite comfortable staying here because of the staff personality, personally. I love the room, I do. But we need not only the room but also the warm welcome. The real warm welcome to everyone unexceptionally. Not the sop warm welcome. Please, if you want to be big, think bigger. It’s not about the looks, it’s about the inside feeling.",Romantic Vacation

Out of all the great design that this hotel offer, the separator between the room is not artsy at all. I called to have an early check in, but they said that they couldn't help. So I bargain to have the check in on 1pm which 1 hour different and they said they will prioritized us. when we came, about 12.30, the room wasn't ready yet-for sure and it ok, and we decided to go to the restaurant to have some lunch. About the restaurant, the price is cheap but the taste was awful. I'm not sure why they lowering their reputation by serving such a not tasty at all food. so I have a very high hope that they serve the breakfast better. Anyway the service also bad. They missed my order, they put a fake smile and serving for the sake of getting paid. We finished our lunch at 1.30 and it was still not ready and we wait. Then I go for the breakfast, the vary is a lot. They serve western, locals and fruits. but the taste is just so-so, even they serve gudeg in outdoor area but the server didn't care about the flies that flying on the gudeg. Because I thought this is a very good hotel, seeing the pictures and the review I expect a very proactive service but again I have to remember this is not even a 4 stars hotel.

I booked executive lake view for 4 nights and it didn't feel like I was staying in yogyakarta. felt more like I was in another dimension and town. right after I opened the room balcony, fishes greeted me and my room quite close to bunnies island. room was quiet and soothing. nice place to have ""me time"" and there are lots of activities to do there. I don't have to go outside the resort to enjoy my holiday. they provide fish meal for idr 10k per small packages. rooms are non smoking but it is allowed to smoke in balcony though they don't provide any ashtray. the employees are very nice, smiles a lot, and helpful. breakfast were awesome and taste good. food are at normal rate with big portion (in my opinion), but better go to westlake resto which located about 100m from resort, for variety of options and nicer views. we spent around idr 250k for 3 types of dishes, 2 drinks, 2 rice...but really looking by the portion, it should be dinner package for 4 people instead of 2. the minus points are : 1. I couldn't find room with bathtub through traveloka. I don't know if they actually have it or not, I forgot to ask. it would be perfect if they have it. 2. bar inside my room was completely empty and the closest minimart is around 1km from the resort.

We were truly satisfied from the moment we checked in until we checked out at the reception counter (thank you Putri for your attentive assistance). Housekeeping also did a very good job with our requests that we didn't need to wait for too long to get things done. Breakfast was good, and the waiter at the omelet stall was so nice to us. Other staffs were all nice and attentive as well. Not to mention, the facilities were great to the point we pledged to go back here when we come to Yogya again. However, all of the good stuff above turned into a big disappointment once we were about to leave Porta. Me and my husband rode a motorbike all the way from Semarang to Yogya. We parked it at the basement as per staff direction. I think it's mixed with the staff' motorbike area. We were suggested not to ""kunci setang"" by one of the staff we met at the basement. We were shocked to see our motorbike was moved and crammed, surrounded with other motorbikes to the point we could not get our motorbike out from the parking area. My husband tried to figure out how to move the other motorbikes but it was too much. We wanted to ask for help from the people around but they only glanced at us. The staff were only looking at us. Probably they thought we were strangers who were not the hotel guests so they didn't even spare us an assistance. I tried to look for a security but couldn't find any. So there my husband moved and turned back the other motorbikes all on his own. We just hope that Porta don't discriminate guests with motorbike like us. Imagine if we go outside a lot and our motorbike is positioned like that every time we fetch our motorbike. This one point makes us think twice if we will choose Porta again for our next stay.",Staycation

I'm not quite sure how the five-stars rating given, but other than the rooms itself, I didn't quite the feel of staying in a five-stars hotel. It actually positive side, the price itself was not five stars, I got it at the rate around IDR 1,5 mio (with discount from app) for two nights. But I think it really was too cheap for a five-stars hotel and my suspicions was right. Starting from the price, everything felt like a three stars hotel. The toiletries really did felt like three-stars quality. There was a hole in the curtain, a crack in the mirror of the TV table and the carpet was super dusty. When I step on the carpet during the process of putting my shoes, dust coming out from the carpet. I wonder did they vacuum the carpet regularly? Moving from there, the Gym was so small with only three equipment. The Pool was adequate, it's just that I think, why don't they made the pool into infinity pool, considering the location was on top of the roof and facing the Merapi Mountain, too bad. After that I had my breakfast. The night before, the front desk officer informed me that the breakfast will be ready from 6am to 10am. I arrived at the restaurant at 6.10 am yet the breakfast is still not fully ready and to make matter worse, the door to their (super-awfully-messy-and-smelly) kitchen was opened. Totally ruined my day. The variant of the brealfast itself is not that vast, the way they serving the food also feels like three-stars quality. The hotel itself feels Great, the comfort of the pillow, the bed, and the ambience is super classy and made you feel like you're in a European-themed room. Super fancy. But that alone can't validate the five-stars status, in my opinion. This hotel only feels like a Three-Stars Boutique Hotel to me. Now everything back to you.

My room is on 6th floor, originally, but due to many trouble there, I asked to staffs and they kindly moved my family and I to 5th floor (big thanks for the kindness!) for food, I ordered nasi goreng and spaghetti bolognese, and all tasty (i skipped breakfast, hehe) since the building is old, so you might have chance to experience eerie things.

Really had a bad experience staying here, from the beginning and to end, really, there's nothing that makes us want to come back and staying here again. Regarding service, that is all we can tell about less and more, because honestly our family did not feel the warmth of the Marriot family during our stay here. And for room reviews, you can see for yourself based on photos that we have shared, then judge it for yourself how appropriate it is for a hotel that is part of the Marriot.

Secondly, the parking area was too far from the lobby and if we don't get the closer one which was impossible to get, so we need to walk around 100 meters up, there is no buggy available, did you ever consider if raining or to someone that has some movement disadvantage over that?

I mean I understand about limited staff during this time, but for limited towel? I don't think it's plausible. And the worst part?

So, I don't know whether those are old towels or its really the color but I don't think u'd say its the second option when you see it. oh and 4) food was okay but the variations should be considered. if it was not 4 star hotel, i'd not ask for more.",Family vacation

Unfortunately, I did not try the pool yet, as I never leave my room, so homey and cozy. “Pulang ke uttara” is really a perfect name, as you feel like you are on your own home.

We booked their Sky Room for 2 nights, while the 3rd night we booked their Suite Room directly via the Hotel website because I wanted to celebrate my fiance's birthday there. In all my life, this hotel gave me the worst experience. We do agree that the hotel is very Instagramable, and we took a lot of pictures there. But being instagrammable wasn't enough to satisfy us customers in the hospitality industry. Here are some of the bad experiences that we'd like to share: 1. Hotel was located in an alley. and that alley is really small and tight (only fits 1 car) 2. The parking lot is really small and bad. The valet team were also not really useful. We spent around 20 minutes just to go out from the parking lot alone. Oh, it was also dark, only one way street outside of the alley. If we missed the alley, we had to turn around or move backwards. 3. Sky Room reviews: - The floor is dusty (as if it's not mopped) - The AC leaked (Room 315) - The rooms are not soundproof 4. Suite Room - The service was extremely bad, they didn't transfer our luggage directly to the room after we left it at receptionist. we had to ask them to do it. No pro activity. - We already paid full upfront on the day we arrived (3 days before), I also reminded them about our special request to the receptionist, but they didn't place enough attention. they didn't even know at first that we had a special request. Until I reminded them on the day we moved. - On the day we were about to stay at the suite room, the receptionist told us that the private pool was in treatment and cannot be used!! - The private pool was green and filled with moss, and the hotel manager told us that due to high season and the suite room is always fully booked, they could not find the time to treat the pool (what a ridiculous excuse!) - They just offered us to pay half-price of the room, but finally we refused and asked them to transfer us to our previous room in Deluxe. - It took us around 2 hours to negotiate with them. What a waste of time, because they had to get decisions from their HQ. - We could not change to other suite rooms because this is the only suite room that they have, that has private swimming pool. That's all our story, wanna go back? No thank you.",Romantic Vacation

Though you can walk to the beach, the traffic heading to the hotel was quite a nightmare. Not sure if this is an area to stay at if you truly want to chill. Dealing with traffic and confusion of where to park was definitely a turn-off. The room wasn't soundproof, you could hear whatever/whoever outside your room/corridor. Couldn't properly rest.

Make it 14.00 would be more efficient for the visitor. 2. There’s NO privacy, literally, I can hear what the other visitor’s conversation in room next to mine. Could the hotel do something to make it more “soundproof”? 3. I took the fresh fruit for bfast, but I knew it wasn't new and it's been refrigerated from not the same day. It disappointed me. The same complaint goes to fresh milk. But hey, the hotel itself is super duper insta-able!! Every corner is of it so pretty.

The architecture itself is mesmerizing, the pool garden is superb, & the staff are nice. But the room we were in is considered small compared to other hotels we've ever been to with the same rate. The main problem is the air conditioner in our room. It was already on for several hours but it's doing nothing to the temperature. We were literally sweating in our room. We called the front office & they sent a technician to check the air-con. The technician did the checking twice at 1 am, could you imagine. He then said that there were some errors and it already got fixed, but we're still sweating an hour later (2 am). I called the front office again and finally asked to change my room. They upgraded our room to a better room with a working air-con, finally, but it was already 3 am. We didn't enjoy our stay at all & I decided to rent another room in another hotel for the next day, even though we already paid for 2 nights. My point is, they should've changed our room since the first time I called the front office and told them the air-con wasn't working. It was in the middle of the night & they had to send a technician to check the air-con? That was inappropriate & unprofessional. And the most disappointing part? They told me when I checked out that they already knew that there was a problem with the air-con in our room, but because the hotel was full so they had to put us in that room.

Careful. Bathroom was a nice size with toiletries included. Liquid soap and shampoo in dispensers hanging on wall in shower. Bar soap also provided. Mini bar provided with snacks for purchase.

Smoking permitted pool side. 5.0 stars Food: Breakfast buffet was acceptable as there was a fair offering but nothing was hot. Eggs made to order and cooked properly. Indonesian food with a western mix is how I would describe it. Coffee tasted like the grounds were used twice. Overall, I felt the breakfast was good. 4.0 stars Menu items while limited had both local and western offerings. we only ate once there with me having the chicken club, wife and daughter having local. I was fortunate to sample theirs. All was excellent. 5.0 stars. Staff: Friendly and helpful. Always first to smile and offer a greeting everytime! Made us all feel welcome and our business appreciated. Overall, outstanding. 5.0 stars. Overall I would rate this hotel at 4.7 stars. Would I stay here again? Absolutely. One of the things I liked about the location was it being set back off the main road making it considerably buffered from the sounds and activities from the main strip while still being located in all the activities. Kind of like the best of both worlds. Our room was 360 and we had no issues with loud music keeping us awake at night. Now one issue I did have was the offer for 100,000 IDR to rent floaties. According to the sign, hopefully picture will be attached, it included drink AND snack but according to the staff and the night manager in charge it included drink or snack. As I had a rather enjoyable conversation about misleading advertising with the manager, he insisted that AND meant OR. While the cost wasn't my concern but his reasoning for the discrepancy was. Not to mention his approach of at first trying to act like he couldn't hear the conversation between another staff member and I ( although he was literally, literally, literally one foot, 12 inches, away). His Excuse was that he wasn't paying attention. Finally, I would say it was his attitude of it being more important to project an aire of...that's the way it is so deal with it. The only reason I mention this is for those of you who read this review to this point know And means OR and you ain't getting a snack and a beverage. Again, small price and on the grand scheme of things, relatively small issue.",Family vacation

Got my king size bed, stayed in the room, another 2 male staffs knocked on door, I ignore it again (this time around I locked the door), they keep knocking on door, I keep ignoring, they tried to come in anyway pushing the door hard like they about to rob the room.. I get angry and open the door and complain. 3. Receptionist told me, ""do you know there's a dnd button for front door?"" uh huh, but do you know some guests didn't lock the door and just take shower anyway and still no staff dare to come in after being ignored knocking the door anyway? This is the right sop for all housekeeping staffs at hotels. When they knock the hotel room door and ignored, they move on to next room, not barge in.

The last, when I open the bed cover, lots of small dirty dust or even more than a dust. I hope the management will be brought up this kind of cleanliness which for certain people is very important.

Added breakfast buffet during check-in. Breakfast was bland, slow response from staffs, the only memorable thing on the breakfast buffet is the coffee and the squirrels on nearby trees. Mid breakfast it was raining, only 3 tables on outdoor areas affected by rain, no help at all from staffs to move us to different table. Check out time of the hotel is at 11am, I was not informed, calling them 11.40ish (because I thought check-out was at 12pm) to ask for late check out at 1pm, not nicely they said no due to a large group incoming and they are fully booked. Me being annoyed just got back from the beach, checked out with hair all over the place, my son only rinsed out from sand and calling the bell boy to get me the hell out of there ASAP. In parallel I checked room availability on travel apps, 2 rooms, across multiple platforms they are available. So not only they are not nice, they are lying! Oow one thing right about them is the service staffs at the beach.

I called the front desk regarding to  this matter and she said she would discuss it with her manager and call me back. Guess what she didn't give me a call. Than they have bicycles, but you have to rent it. 60k per hour. We stayed at Westin, we can use bicycles all we want! Their cleaning staffs weren't using gloves while cleaning up beds pillows etc. Hello. You think I didn't notice? I asked  front desk officer why cleaning staffs aren't using gloves, and they denied it, they say they always use glove. Lie. There 's a fridge in the room but it smells bad. No bath rope. No sandals. No coffee cups, coffee, tea etc. Than I called the front office again, and they said, coffee cups tea coffee will be given upon guests' request. Are you kidding me!

The room is less occupancy, so I requested if I could change my room near the lobby or view of pool etc. but they not provided my request, and we got a room very very far from the lobby without elevator that works there.

He is a guy, he said that with my promo rate cant get mineral water for free as complimentary, I was super shocked, even I explained to him.. even in the budget hotel they provided us 2 mineral water for complimentary . And I said I will review about this bad things in Traveloka..and the reception guy said go head pls its ok ..without saying sorry at all...where is the manner and hospitality services? And after that..someone ( its a girl) calling me asked about mineral water, and she explained that theres 2 free mineral water in the room near the wardrobe.

First they told us the room wasn't ready because someone wanted to change room and had a look at the 'supposed to be our' room, but they cancelled, I asked whether there was any problem with the room and they said no, just being checked. If so, why should we waited for a period of time?
Another 15 mins gone by, so they said the room was ready, we were ushered to a room on the 2nd floor, when we arrived in front of the room, there was a housekeeping work still in progress, we went back to the lobby. Wait for another 15 mins, the room was ready as they said. Again, we were ushered to the room on the 6th floor, upon entering the room we knew it right away that the room wasn't the one we booked, it was a street view room while we actually booked for the pool view, another 15 mins gone by in the room until we once again ushered to the other room on the 3rd floor, further down the alley.
It all took almost an hour just to get us checked in, and become rushed to prepare for a dinner reservation. Everything else was OK, and the true saving grace was the staff who ushered us all the time, kudos for him.",Leisure

She just suggested us to wait at the outdoor pool bar and have complimentary drinks while waiting.

Sorry to give a unsatisfying review due to comparison of our stay before at Courtyard Nusa Dua. Maybe it seems unfair, but I have to write it here since it is under the same brand name. In this hotel, the Private beach operational time is just too short, from 10 AM to 6 PM only. The shuttle to beach is limited by time. Also, there is No pickup by hotel from the beach. Guests have to walk back to hotel, eventhough it only takes about 15-20 mins by foot, but still on holiday, we love to be served better...haha.. There is 1 more thing that made me feel bad about this hotel (again, compared to the one at Nusa Dua), is the problem solving skill from reservation staff. Our trip is due to be cancelled since there is 2 persons from our big family had cought covid19 virus. Since then, we tried to reschedule the stay, but staff from this hotel were not friendly at all. Always told us that the booking should be rescheduled by the travel agent. On the other hand, travel agent asked us to made confirmation to hotel if it could be rescheduled. I know there is procedure by hotel and travel agent. But at least, help us as the customer. We don't know how the procedures between hotel and agent, those are your internal problems. But don't treat us like that. In the same problem, we got a good solution from Courtyard Nusa Dua. The staffs there promised us to reschedule the stay, even after all, we still have to ask confirmation from agent, but the staffs were really helpful to us. These 2 hotels are in the same brand, but why the management are so differed???",Holiday

The check in lobby is located in the 62th floor and the employee accompanies us to get there from ground floor. The check in process takes around 30mins (quite long). Turns out that we need to put IDR 1mio for deposit via credit card or cash. Unfortunately I don't have any credit card and doesn't bring that much money. Finally we are allowed to use debit card but the process is complicated too. The room is clean and very nice. They provide bath salts and the bathtubs is big so it's very enjoyable. You can ask for an additional amenities and order food via their smart TV. I was planning to have an afternoon tea in the Alice restaurant but it hasn't operated yet (what a pity). Thus we decided to go to Astha District 8 for window shopping. We had our breakfast at the Tom's. The are lots of menu that you can choose but we need to wait for 1 hour until our order is getting served. There's a gym and pool in 63th floor but we need to make a booking first and again unfortunately it's already full booked so I cannot experience the pool. Overall it's nice but there are some facilities or amenities that are not available yet because they just opened the hotel several days ago.

The check-in process is fast and uncomplicated. Then we were ushered to our room by the receptionist. Our room type is Deluxe Skyline King Room, and we got a room on the 57th floor. The room is lovely and luxurious. The toilet is also very modern and automatic. Our view room was right next to the FWD/Citibank building. Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks in the room was that the bed was hard and uncomfortable. Also, the mattress in our room turned out to be a combination of two twin bed mattresses, so when sleeping, it didn't feel flat between the middle of the mattress and the edge of the mattress. There are many beautiful spots for photos in this hotel, especially in the outdoor pool. For photos here, we should have it at night with decorative lights from the buildings around the hotel. To use the swimming pool, you must make a reservation in advance at the reception. For breakfast, there are two kinds of dishes. The first was a buffet, and the second was a la carte, so we had to order it through the waiter. It tastes pretty good. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the type of food for a hotel as luxurious and expensive as this is not much compared to other hotels I've been visiting.",Staycation
125755046,9000000971405,Rendi J.,9.4,"The amenities, facilities, and the design are aesthetically pleasing. The quality of food is good, especially for breakfast. But what I want to highlight are the service in general and the access in and out of the hotel room/building. Let me elaborate the points below. 1. The service is quite good yet not reaching the excellence. Knowing it's a holiday, I think this hotel needs to add some personnel's to serve customers better. They were helpful but everything was in too rush. The example is breakfast was divided into sessions. I had meals with my friend and the impression that I got is we have to finish it quickly. I don't think that ' s the 5 star service would do but it happened somehow. Frankly speaking, It's like you were staying in 4 star hotel. 2. The access is kind of limited and the parking area was very confusing since you've arrived. There is no clear guidance where to park and every securities always told me to park somewhere else because the parking area is for employees who work there. Having said about the access, the route from parking area to the hotel building is complicated as the parking area is merged with Ashta, several offices in Revenue tower, and The Gourmet as well. Thus my suggestion for those who brings own vehicle would be following the pink-colored wall as you're inside the basement parking. Always ask the staffs if you don't know how to get to the hotel. The values they're selling are only for designs and features within the hotel building/room such as automatic toilet, nice vibe bathtub, ironing tools, smart TV with its chromecast function, and so on. You can also hear the TV ' s sound from inside the bathroom which was surprisingly fascinating! Apart from that, I would like to rate this hotel 4.5 out of 5. If I have to decide, I think it ' s not that's worth every penny"". I would say it deserves 1.5-2 Mio rather than 3. 2-3.4 Mio in IDR per night for the hotel rate cause some things might be better in terms of customer ' s experience etc. Thanks.",Staycation

First, they don't accommodate the request to store breastmilk (despite it's put neatly in a small coolbox, they just need to put it in the freezer), even for ice gel, they need to see the size and if it's ok for them to help storing it. It's a huge shame for 5 starts hotel, super bad service. Second, there's no kids menu available anywhere in the hotel. Even kids above 3yo needs to pay to eat buffet 50% of adult price (I mean come on, how much foods do they think a 3 yo can eat?). Third, there's no entertainment for kids anywhere in the hotel. Forth, the AC is freaking cold, it's a central AC so you can't control the temp, my 2 month old boy was freezing to the point his hand and feet turned bluish everytime I need to change his diaper. Fifth, the room was old and small. The bed was too soft, I woke up with back ache. Super disappointing for a 5-star hotel, I've stayed in a much better place in Jakarta.

Turns out we were not eligible for the 1 free breakfast we used earlier in the morning and the staff made an error; even though we still have 500 thousand rupiah unused meal voucher in select restaurants. Then the reception manager asked us to name and identify the staff who made the error in a way that makes us feel guilty in doing so.

124026906,4755,Indra N. H.,6.9,"So here’s my review: • Services: We got an excellent services here. Professional yet so friendly and helpful at the same time. Thumbs up. • Bedroom: I just booked a junior suite room for a night. It was really spacious. I love all the details they put in the room. The bed was really really comfortable. • Bathroom: They provide bath up and shower to refresh your body. Thing that I like from the bathroom is their complete and cool amenities. Both bedroom and bathroom had a luxury design with marmer and a fancy interior. But, I had to say that I was really really dissapointed with: • The reason why I chose Mulia as my hotel to do a staycation is because I want to taste their well known breakfast. But it turns out really unsatisfying. They only provide fried rice, fried noodle, porridge, and egg for the main course. I really understand in the middle of covid19 outbreak, they had to reduce the cost of breakfast but I personally think they chose the wrong way. I mean there’s a lot of choice they could take such as: - We choose our own breakfast from table8 menu - The breakfast served to the guest room (like for what that we leave our room for the really standard breakfast) I tried to understand maybe the fried rice/fried noodle had an amazing taste, but you know what? ‘Nasi goreng tek tek’ is way much more delicious than Mulia’s breakfast. They gave us the really really traditional fried rice which doesn’t have an amazing raste. Nor the fried noodle, it was really really standard noodle, gosh I can't even say more than standard. I mean they are a 5 stars hotel, but the taste was just the same as a 2 stars hotel, I’m sorry but I have to say this. I was really really disappointed with Mulia’s breakfast. Really really disappointed. • The second is, when I booked the room in Traveloka, it stated that I got a 650.000 IDR voucher to be spent in Table 8 but turns out I only got 350.000 IDR voucher. When I asked the receptionist, they told me that Traveloka didn't update the benefit details of the room. So yea, whoever did a wrong here, the guest is the only one who get a loss. Hopefully what I reviewed could be a suggestion for their improvement.",Staycation

Also when I book the room I was asking for a high floor room and guess what, they gave me a room with a view of people swimming in front of our window. I was asking for a higher floor but they said non are available anymore. Breakfast was also the worst I have ever tasted in a Four Star Hotel. Another thing is the carpet in our room was kind of dirty that we had to ask them to vacuum it on our second day of stay. That's right 2 nights of a nightmare with my family. 🤦 Actually the hotel is not very bad, even if it is quite old but I think the management is very bad. Hope they can fix how they run the hotel and know better how to treat their paying customers. Thank you. 🙏",Staycation

I was checking in on Dec 31 at 3pm, with booking made over than 2 weeks prior, my request was simple : a non smoking room in a higher floor. During the checking in, they said that the non smoking rooms were fully occupied so they made me seeing another room which they claimed as a bigger room, but for smoking, turned out the room is so smelly, so I refused the room. After waiting for 10 minutes, they said that upgraded me to a bigger room, non smoking, in the 5th floor. I accepted cause what can I say? The new room was ok, looked like a 1BR residence, but it was so cold, I think there's no heater and wasn't occupied for long times. 2. Parking area is full. We get that Dec 31 meaning the hotel has a big occupancy rate, but I think they has more guests than what they can handle. Even the parking area was too full, so they made us driving around for a while and finally gave us a parking spot in front area of the hotel. 3. Terrible breakfast. I waited for 2 hours for my pre-ordered breakfast to be finally served to my room at 11AM. D-1, I ordered 2 breakfasts for 2 people at 9AM! After kept calling the restaurant and reception for hours, they didn't show up until 11AM. Not only that, the breakfast is non edible, didn't finish mine, it was cold too. By making me waiting for 2 hours, they didn't even preheat the dishes in microwave. The taste is below average, the portion is small.",Staycation

So here are the details. 1. Everything started right from when I just arrived. I can't use debit card to pay deposit. LOL what kind of hotel that still using cash nowadays? They should know using cash is easier to spread COVID. 2. The aircon is hot (seems like they didn't maintain the room) 3. The telephone line is broken. Literally OFF. So every time I need a favor, I have to go down many times! So useful huh. Seriously, this is horrible, what if there ' s an emergency and I need help? 4. There's a lamp beside the bed yet it can't be turned off! Seems like there ' s a problem with their lining wiring. Now I cannot sleep with the lights on! 5. And anyways I won't forget to mention that it says this hotel is 5 stars, yet their hospitality is horrible. Not friendly at all! Even when I asked them to fix the telephone many times, they didn't tell me that it's under maintenance until the engineering guy told us! I'll never go back here again. Worst hotel ever!

So far mercure hotel gatot subroto doesn’t act like any 4 🌟 hotel. Here’s are some of issues that I faced while staying at this hotel: 1. Waiting too long for check in In this staycation, as family consist of 4 we order 2 privilege room that has connecting door. I have been call the hotel in advance to know if they have connecting room for 30 April and they said they had those room. While check in, we have to wait for 1 hour until they give us those 2 rooms. At first they said the room is not ready and will be ready at 4/5pm (actually we don’t get the room right away because there’s a VIP Group that ask upgrade for their room so all the privilege room are full so we need to wait another customer to check out at 3/4 pm haha) but we refuse to wait so they gave us free upgrade for 1 room to executive room (thanks for that!) and escort us to the room immediately. 2. We ask to the receptionist at check in counter is this non covid hotel? Does they serve quarantine people? They said this non covid hotel that doesn’t serve quarantine people from aboard. We are so happy knowing that. But another nightmare come.. at 10 pm when we went to the lobby there’s a group from another country that holding a boarding pass while check in. I call the receptionist right away.. and they have different statement “yes ma’am we serve quarantine room, but we serve them at different floor from regular customer”. I just wondering why they lie at the first place by told us this is not quarantine hotel 🤣. 3. Ask for sahoor at room. At 11 pm knowing that this hotel serve for quarantine people and the restaurant is need to be access with the same lift as the quarantine rooms, we decide to take the sahoor at the room at 2.30 AM. We have been waiting for 1 hour until 3.30 Am but the food didn’t come to our room, we call the restaurant and in room dining but they don’t pick up the phone. So we decide to go to the restaurant right away, at the lobby the security ask “do you have access to eat at restaurant” and we said “ yes we have, we are in room xxx and xxx”. The security call the restaurant and people from restaurant said we don't have access to eat the buffet at the restaurant because we order the food to be serve at our room (yes the food didn’t come of course lol). We argue and the staff from restaurant and the security answer us not politely. In the end, after long argumentation they allow us to eat at the restaurant huft.

Almost everything is as expected - except on our request for a non-smoking room, they said that even I have chose a non-smoking room in application, there's a glitch in their system where it can't read those additional requests. Well I was a little bit disappointed about this, when we walk towards our room and inside the room, the smell of cigarettes is quite strong. I worried because we have a baby with us. I talked to the staff that if any inconvenience happened due to the smell of cigarette smoke, I'll call them. But thank God, an hour after we arrived and turned on the AC, the smoke is no longer smelled and we can stay peacefully for 3 days. The room has a terrific view which can fulfill my hubby's desire in photography to catch some eye-catching cityscape. The food is 8/10 for me. The resto has various appetizer, various main course, and various dessert. And we love them. For other services (staff, cleanliness, facility, access, etc.) I will give it 9/10. Good job for Mercure and thank you. I hope the renovation will be finished soon.",Staycation

No issue with the provided internet connection and TV channels. Hall/ballroom could cater meeting event well. Parking was still free when we stayed there.

The receptionist guy was nice and reminded me to make another reservation via application or I can make a reservation directly to the hotel but with higher price. Either way is no problem for me. Then the next day, my room phone rang and I didn’t make it to answer the call, I immediately thought this must be about extending the stay and immediately checked application. Unfortunately the same grade of hotel room was not available anymore. I called the reception and she told me that I can extend my stay but with different grade of hotel room, which is lower. Grade of hotel room is no objection for me, but if I were continue extending my stay, that’s means I need to repack my stuff which is troublesome for I need to go to someplace as soon as possible. I think hotel should prioritize the “already” guest more in this case. I didn’t feel comfortable with the service of receptionist. It is as if the hotel only prioritize make income by making sure their rooms occupancy rather than make hotel guest as comfortable as possible Second, when check-in I did mention that I want to use laundry service and ask about how long does it take to complete. They can do the same day service if the laundry bag is retrieved by hotel room boy before 10.00 AM in the morning. Okay, I was so tired from long flight Paris to Jakarta, I was sleeping into oblivion until 10.15 AM and wake up immediately remembering that laundry had not been retrieved. Searching for housekeeping guy in my floor and ask whether I can hand over the laundry and will be completed in the same day. He said that it is already too late to be completed the same day and also he mentioned that he already knocked my room door in an attempt to retrieve my laundry. This is not possible, I always wake up when someone call me or knock my room while I’m sleeping, doesn’t matter how deep I am sleeping.

S.,6.7,Short: overall is good (4/5) but too much dissatisfaction resulting in complaint for ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ class hotel long: /checkin process + arrival lucky draw for special item + ice cream welcome treat + super kind hotelier - long & complicated checkin process (esp. Register membership) - need to deposit money /room + premium furniture + spacious room + watering & air-conditioning tools is top notch -- we found previous guest trash on refrigerator while room is already sealed - thin tissue. Poor quality - jet flush is half-broken. Cant control the power /guest services + responsive & quite helpful + they offer upgrade room & amenities when we complaint about the trash (just so unfortunate we cant accept the room upgrade since we just arrived from flight and prefer to rest). The bath bomb/bath liquid is awesome - some (2) young inexperienced staff cant answer when we questioning food-related inquiry (we're foodies) /food + signature food is a must-try + variety isnt as much as any other hotel but the taste is solid + pastry is tasty and we love the cheese palate! ❤️❤️❤️ - limited fresh juice option,Staycation

Came with 3 reasons: (1) The front desk got me wrong bedroom 2X; They gave me a room that already had another guest inside the room and it was the same floor with covid quarantine area. When I tapped the key and entered the room, the existing guest screamed and shocked me then we found out that another guest was already in that room a. K. A the front desk gave me room-in-use (2) Second room, they gave me bad quality room (smoking one vs my request for non smoking room). The room had super strong toilet drainage smell and the staff even had to use such air neutralizer for cleaning the bad air. Since this is the smoking-type of bedroom, the room had holes in the sofa, cigarettes burn on the table and dirty smear on the desk under TV (3) Then we were moved and Finally got a correct room but the staff did not mention that tomorrow's breakfast would be brought into the room because the restaurant would be used for wedding event. During check in, The staff told me to come to restaurant tomorrow for breakfast instead. When I arrived at the restaurant, it had wedding event in it and people starred at me wearing casual sleeping clothes. In the end, I got my breakfast at 11AM (1 hour before check out).",Staycation

I did ask the front desk to have my room changed immediately as I booked non smoking room, with request of 11 pm check in time (that should have been prepared by them) , but somehow the front desk staff (male) that night was so unfriendly by saying the rooms were all full and non-smoking room is subject to availability, and he ended up with sarcastic smile by offering to spray some air freshener (which I think I totally not useful), before I hang up the phone. 3.

When we finally stayed there, we found that amenities were provided only for one person even though we booked for 2 persons. The shower knob in the bathroom was also broken before we even went to take a bath. The WiFi was slow and frequently just loading and loading. The breakfast was just okay for a 5-star hotel. One little thing that I never experienced at other hotels was that 1 hour prior to check-out time (12pm), the hotel lobby called our room and reminded us that check-out time was at 12pm and no later than that. Also, for everyone that are going to stay at this hotel, please make sure that you always have your parking ticket validated at the hotel lobby otherwise you will have to pay hefty price for parking. Nobody at the lobby will offer you to validate the parking ticket. I hope this review helps the potential guests in making decision and the hotel itself in improving itself.",Family vacation

Turned out it was for 2 hotels’ check-ins (harris vertu & Yello, it looks like they’re from the same company). Also, there was a wedding celebration of some sort so there were a lot of people passing by. It was quite uncomfortable, to say the least. I waited in line for more than an hour and the checking-in process was very time-consuming. Maybe I just got unlucky for booking the hotel on this date and time, which was my birthday. I planned this booking for my birthday weekend stay. I could say it was disappointing. The internet was extremely slow, the TV signal was in and out, the view from our room wasn’t the best, room service took more than half an hour, the fridge wouldn’t make my beverages cold.

Then, the lift was very slow, it took 20 minutes to get in to the lift. Besides that, the room facilities mentioned in web are actually different with the actual. My room didn’t have bath-tub as mentioned in app. Then, I called the front desk and told them that I booked the room with Bath-tub and they said that the room with bath-tub is unavailable. I insisted that I want the room with bath-tub as I booked, but they asked me to wait. I waited for 2 hours until I get the room with bath-tub.",Romantic Vacation

BCA's security can teach them better 😊. Then the service was sucks when I asked for spoons and forks for me to eat, it took them 30 minutes or so to deliver it ☺ I mean it ' s only spoons and forks, do they need to bought it somewhere first?

When called before, they mentioned kids under 5 were not allowed in the pool, but yet we saw tons of them in the pool and in my opinion the pool had too many people to be considered social distancing. Another aspect that was lacking was our experience at the Satoo breakfast. We felt like the taste was lacking in every food stall, not sure its because the chefs cant have a taste due to their covid protocols or this is the norm? Further, we had a bug inside the pepper jar, in which regardless I had expected an individual packet to be given instead of a shared salt and pepper jars. Nevertheless the staff apologized nicely. The horizon lounge was actually indeed the best part with the cocktail hours being a great deal. The gym was also done correctly with the partitions on the cardio machines, but why no boundaries between the lift machines/equipments? Most of the other restaurants are still close, so options are limited, but the rooms were nice and clean, thus overall, not bad but not great. 3/5 stars",Staycation

Had to wait 6 hours to be checked in to both rooms that we booked with the reason that “housekeeping couldn’t get the room ready on time” and no other explanation. Additionally, no one brought our luggages to our rooms so I had to come down and manually brought our own luggages. What a disastrous check-in.",Family vacation
121492860,7347,Ahmad S. R. ,6.8,"So,
Starts with the long queue at check in 2PM. This is expected due to peak Eid holiday. (but FYI Kempinski H.I. which is fully booked on the same day, and my brother and sisters had no queue there)

The queue is well organized, with more than 6 receptions. One can hope that the queue move a bit faster. (oh of course horizon got special priority)
My turn came after 30 minutes. He swiped my card for deposits and told me to use the facilities while waiting for the roon to be cleaned (of course no time estimation, and he cant mentioned the room number until its ready.. funny). I made sure to him to call my number when it s ready, as i told him to respell my phone number.

Am not in the mood for swimming or anything else while still not having the room for the luggage and cloth changing, so we just sat there.

15 minutes passed, with the view of other visitors anxiously waiting for their rooms.
So we decided to leave and went to Grand Indonesia, as this is the nearest entertainment place from the hotel. (such a discomfort)

3 hours passed still no call. so at 5PM i called the hotel, and asked them to check if my room were ready. and they said they will call me back. of course, nothing as u may have guessed.
so we wait in my brothers hotel room in Kempinski. (again, such a hassle)

at last at 7PM (5 hours) one called saying the room is ready.
wow, just wow.

The room is clean and great. but of course room wise you would prefer the newer ones eh? :) newer better design, higher ceiling, with the usb socket/charger on each side of the bed. 
The pool and its garden is still one of the biggest and greatest.
Breakfast at Satoo.. becomes nothing more than the others. nothing special. 

All in all, I guess they're waning.. .
They're well known for its great service, and by the look of it, they are capable of it,
But I didn't get any of it.

I waited for approximately 30 minutes, they didn't respond to me, so I called them once again and I was sure that they rejected my call several times before I succeeded, and annoyingly they still couldn't respond to my complaint, and I demanded that they should responded it very soon because I thought I was loosing my patient. Ten minutes later they called my room and offered a late check out, I answered I didn't need that because I was going to check out at 4 am the next morning, my flight was at 5 am.

Receptionist esp the ladies ones are not friendly, even the lady manager did not give a damn even after explaining to them that this is portable rice cooker, and they try to switch it on first to check if the power gonna trip.

But unfortunately this second stay was rated less than okay. Room is big and check in process was fast until the porter who delivered my suitcases came. He threathened our family and our luggages in a very impolite way saying that after screening, our stuff was not appropriate for the hotel and the manager would come shortly to pick up our stuff and not allowed us to use it. Hey, I didn't bring any bomb or illegal drugs! He is only porter and does not have the capacity to threaten guests that way, especially I am paying for my stay and not a free stay. Even after he threathened us that way, I gave him small tip and he accepted it (oh gosh, so cheapo!) Have you and your team clarified with me what happened before your porter threatened us that way? The room is also very clean until we found used wound medicine in one of the shelf, used from prior guests, very disgusting (see picture). Staff at the gym area and housekeeping are okay, they are good and friendly. Even though I can see that housekeeping are not doing very well as bath mats, robes are not provided, and need to be requested, and they only deliver it after sooo longgg (almost 1 hour). The service provided by Four Seasons dropped significantly since my first stay in October. My first stay was the best stay ever in 5 stars hotel in Jakarta, even I recommend all my frinds to try FS! After your staff threathened my family, I wouldnt want to stay at FS considering there are so many good 5 stars in Jakarta that I have been and given their best services. If I can, I will rate FS Jakarta 1.5 stars only, not 2 stars, but agent doesnt allow me to do so.",Staycation

Consequently, to uphold the heavy name is truly a challenge no amateur can do. When it comes to Four Seasons, it is not my first time staying at this establishment. Previous experiences were exemplary and this hotel became my go-to place if I need to wind down for several days. However, my latest experience in October was abysmal to say the least. Truly disappointment, after disappointment, after disappointment left me bitter. 1. Professionalism. To start, the reception attending our requests through WhatsApp always say the wrong name despite multiple attempts to rectify the personnel. This goes on until I checked out of the hotel, I'm confident he/she still do not know my name. 2. Cleanliness. The bath water at one point in time was yellow like urine. Upon complaint, the assistance provided was at bare minimum and it took a whole 45minutes for the water to become somewhat ""clear"". Even worse, the reception in charge of WhatsApp did not even apologize when the complaint was made - none whatsoever. 3. Professionalism. Again. Finally on my last day, I requested for my free breakfast to be held in-room (it is an option that can be done). However, upon checking out, I was charged for the breakfast meal and was forced to wait for 20 minutes by the receptionist because they had to make sure I was telling the truth - as if I am a thief! The incidents left me enraged; Honestly. Such a shame. The beautiful Four Seasons name had to carry the burden of this amateur service team in Jakarta, Indonesia.",Staycation

Don’t get me wrong. The room was as shown on the gallery. The facility was as listed in the listing. The location was as good as it is pointed. So, the hotel is fine.

Unfortunately my experience was not.

- I was looking for a parking space from P1 to P3 and going back to P1. And yet i got none. The security that we asked to help was gone in a poof and nowhere to be seen. And so we complaint to the gate personnel. Still we are charged. The amount does not matter, but basically we are charged for driving around in a parking lot, trying to find a parking space that does not exist and finished up with a different form of “screw you.”

- Plumbing in my room was upset which upset me as well. When we came in, the floor was extremely dirty, and don’t even start with me with the smell, it is like someone was puking on the floor. I called the guest service. They say they will bring a person in. Around 7 minutes passed and no one came. Once, okay? I called again. Again they said they will bring another one up to my room. I waited for a bit longer this time. 9? 10 minutes? No one came. Twice, alright? So i called the third time with a tad of fury, and after several minutes finally someone came. And then that someone realized that it is a major problem (what a surprise *rolled eyes) and retrieve their engineers asap. Apparently the pipes were not able to hold grey water or dirty water and spouted them back to my bathroom floor. Can you imagine the smell and my disgust? We were moved to another room immediately. Two very bad points here; their lack of care of my discomfort annoyed me. I called three times until they came. What a “pleasant” and “swift” attitude. And moving room? It would have been okay if we got an upgrade or something, but if i had to move in the beginning of the evening i would have chosen another hotel. Not another room on the same floor on the same hotel. Nuts. But, they did offer free fruits. Because i cannot buy the fruits by myself and it was an apple, some grapes, and a banana. What a wonderful apology. yea right, it was a sarcasm for those of you who don’t get it.

We get a room that have quite unpleasant smell, but we were still okay with it since after the AC turned on, the smell was completely gone.

At that point we we're completely doubting about the hotel's cleanliness, we're afraid that the room wasn't cleaned thoroughly, how can the hotel failed to clean such as clear on sight item? But yet again we're still OK even though we're still scared. But then when we're about to rest at night, we found a lot of ants were crawling on our beds and walls, so we cannot rest well. We decided to call the hotel and ask for a room replacement, just to get another room that have the same issue and this time even included a cockroach on the wall! We're too tired from lack of sleep to move to another room so we decided not to call for another replacement. Just to be clear, in the morning we complaint and explained everything to the hotel, and all they did was apologize. We believe that with this issue, we as a guest deserves a more proper compensation, not just an apology.

If only she said that I can check in at 10 , I will wait. The second, the room was deluxe type but it was far from the lift. At the end of the alley. And it doesn't have refrigerator. It is my first time too knowing hotel with deluxe and quite pricy. No refrigerator. I brought some juice that I had to drink every 2 hours. Third, the hotel didn't have hairdryer in the room. So when I called to borrow, they said no more. How many actually did they have? Maybe just one🙄. Fourth, the receptionist, when I checked out was the same with I checked in. Her name is muti. I really didn't like how she handled me. She didn't talk about wifi code while I checked in and didn't ask for my car number. Only when I checked out , she just asked.

What if I'm a vegan? can't eat anything? Also didn't get any beverages for the breakfast (no coffee, tea, juice, milk, or even mineral water) The least that this hotel can do was giving 2 main course per room with at least mineral water as I paid for the with breakfast room and the room was meant for 2 person.

And we actually before swimming met a couple of father and toddler to which the toddler actually said he was also having itching all over as well. And to add blame on my pary I already saw the water was very murky. And insisted to swim. So hence the itches. Now its 2am we hear very loud noise that keeps coming and going from the outdoor AC.

The room was clean, spacious and neat. They have bathtub for all room types and it worked great. Clean swimming pool. And the hotel was one from few hotels which include 4th and 13th floor, and I think it’s great. No thoughts of unlucky numbers :p Unfortunately, the lift didn’t work for a day right after we checked in and went to the bedroom. It’s kind of annoying bcs we had to went to the lift and asked to the staffs via phone in the room did the lift had worked, back and forth. We’re at 13th floor and all the emergency doors were closed (and did you expect we took the stairs from 13th floor?), they didn’t provide any other lift too for us, so it’s impossible for us to get to the lobby. It’s hard for us to take our gofood delivery, till the staffs had to deliver our food to our room with a time delay when we were soooo hungry and we wanted the food right away :( The lift didn’t work from afternoon till evening, causing us to check the lift back and forth so many times at three different times bcs we ordered gofood three times that day. One of the most annoying experience was when we asked if the food has been delivered to the receptionist, they said, “Sudah Bu, bisa diambil ya ke bawah” but when I went to the lift, the lift didn’t work again 🙂 I went back to the room and said to the receptionist, “Mas saya mau ambil makanan, tapi gimana caranya saya ke bawah kalau liftnya masih ga berfungsi juga? Dan saya udah laper banget sekarang” and after that they sent the food to our room, again with the time delay. How could they have full confidence to tell us to go to the lobby when the lift still didn’t work? I regretted that they couldn’t fix the lift problem right away and causing so much inconvenience for us. That’s the only downside of this hotel but the most annoying one. Hope they don’t have this technical issue anymore in the future.",Staycation

Some more, I requested high floor on the website and tell the receptionist don’t forget to give me high floor unit, but they put me in 3rd floor unit! Other guests I’ve seen checked-in after me they got much higher floor. The room could feel much smaller than on the pictures. So packed. Not much spaces to put your luggage. There is sound problem for the TV so I cannot hear the sound. The receptionist said wanna bring engineering but till I check out there was nobody coming! Breakfast was only few options and the taste was not good. The only thing I like is the room interior, furniture, utensils, and kitchen appliances are well equipped and in good condition. Bed are comfortable. Toiletries was good. To sum up, this service apartment is just ok. There is much options out there that are better than this. Thanks!",Staycation

I swear I've never written a bad review before, but this place deserves one. When the first time I came to my room, the key didn't work, so I have to get back to the lobby to change the key. And after they changed my key, it still didn't work, luckily there's a housekeeping staff near my room so I asked him to open my room. The room is ugly, far from my expectation, I've seen the better and cheaper 2-star hotels. And the fu**ing TV is broken, no picture just sound, I told the staff and they said that they want to call the engineer but they didn't come. It didn't end there, fast forward to the next day, today, in the morning I tried my key card again and it worked so I thought they already fixed it. I went out and came back late tonight, just to find that my key still didn't work. So I have to get back to the lobby again and ask them to come with me to my room to open it, and I request to change my room, then I went back to my room to get my stuff, then back to the lobby, only to be told that there's no more empty room for me to change. I'm enraged, I think this is the first time I got angry at customer service, I'm sorry, but this place is shit. Then when I asked them for compensation, they told me that they will send me some welcome snacks? Fu**ing bu***hit. I will never stay here again. Thanks for nothing.",Business

First when we were checked-in, we should have checked-in at 2 pm but we get our room at 3.30 pm. Receptions staff are not friendly and are not adept at serving requests. They even asked, “just ordered right? “ even though we ordered 8 days ago. That excuses because they haven't finished cleaning the room. Second, the room not exactly like description on the website, there’r not dinning table in room. We ordered family room with two rooms inside, even though we have planned a nice dinner in the room. And we can’t request 3 set of cutlery, even though our room is for 3 people. And we wait for 30 minutes for 2 set cutlery. It is very illogical for this Covid era, they reasoned because the breakfast ration is only for 2 people. In this covid era, even we ask for up to ten cutlery to be given, this hotel doesn't seem to be running a traveloka clean stay that has been declared. Very different from our previous staycation hotels during this Covid pandemic. And the third person can have breakfast at an additional cost, so the reason for breakfast for 2 is absurd. Third, my husband and I went to the pool on Sunday morning, and suddenly a security guard forbade us to sit next to each other, and I said it was illogical that we slept next to each other but could not sit together, even though there were 2 other families sitting next to each other. And yesterday Saturday we were not forbidden to sit together. The way the security guards convey is very cheesy, like not being trained in a manner to served hotel guests well. Overall I am not comfortable living here because the service does not entertain guests well. On 3-4 September 2020 we stayed at Swiss-Belresort Dago heritage and very much in contrast with this hotel. This was our 11th staycation hotel during the covid area and we always choose hotels that are clean stay and at least 4 stars for safety.

I feel a bit like I was scammed out of just over 1 million Indonesia to be honest. I was going to get some laundry sorted, so I phoned down to ask for some to be collected. An hour and a half later nobody came but I found the bag for laundry and the pad for orders. I saw how much it cost, so I decided to leave it. I phoned down to ask to cancel and was told that'd be find. To be on the safe side I wrote 'changed my mind' on the laundry pad and left it near the front door with a completely empty laundry bag. I put all of my clothes on the far side of the room behind the bed. when I got back that night I found that they'd taken a random assortment of my clothing and had washed it, put it in plastic bags and hangers and left it on the bed. When I checked out I was a little annoyed to find they were charging me around 400,000 for the laundry items, but I kind of figured it solved a problem and I'd live with it. I went out to meet a friend to say goodbye and when I came back to take me things they told me they'd made a mistake when totaling my additional bill and needed to take an additional 800,000 from me. I was flabbergasted and said I was really unhappy but they insisted I paid. I asked for proof that I'd even asked for laundry in the first place and they said they never received the second phone call cancelling (which isn't true) and that they hadn't understood the message on the pad - which they produced - it clearly said 'I changed my mind' and there was no washing in the bag. I didn't know what to do so I paid the bill and left, but the man at the counter took my email address, acknowledged they'd made some huge mistakes and said he thought his manager would refund me the money. I then received this chain of emails which acknowledged they'd made mistakes but won't refund me.",Business travel

The Guest room twin was quite small but cozy enough. Clean room and bathroom. Since we payed extra for our second night they gave us free breakfast for my son for the first day. He's 9yo. That was nice. Breakfast was nice and yummy both my kids enjoyed it. Now the not so nice part was when I ask when we can move to the Family room. It was already 3pm when I ask the reception. They said 'sebentar lagi'. Since I had to go somewhere I said okay. Came back at 5 still no signs for us to go to the family room. Called the receptionist a few times which I only got 'sebentar lagi' again. Finally we got in the room around 6pm. Found some marks on the kids sheets ask for them to be changed. The room wasn't very clean. A bit dusty. I pointed it out to the guy that changed the sheets. Had 1 TV remote for 2 tvs. With this room they said we get a soft toys matching the theme room and other things like cookies etc. I asked for it and the reception said actually with upgrade price we payed it wasn't included, but we will give it anyway.

On the next morning, I tried to go to the sky lounge using my room access card, and it worked. I asked the staffs there about breakfast and others things, and they said the sky lounge is a complimentary For those who can access it. Since I had some appointments on that morning, i left the sky lounge to get my breakfast on the restaurant lobby then met my guests outside the hotel. 
Then on the noon before checking out, i headed to the sky lounge again for a cup of tea. The staffs welcomed warmly and i were offered some snacks. After a cup of tea, a staff asked me how i can get on the sky lounge access? I said, my card allows to do so. She asked me again, how i know that the hotel has sky lounge; then i said, people on the reception informed me. Later, she charged me ""politely"" 250,000 for the refreshment i consumed. And she also added that the sky lounge is free pass for executive room only. Then i argued, why the reception people informed me about it on the other night and why my card had access to that 25th floor if it can only be accessed by executive guests? 
The answer from the ""full-friendly"" staff so annoying for me, ""With all apologize, please name the guys on the other night, and i can say that some guests' access card sometimes is opened for entire floor."" should i memorize all staffs name!? And if it is true about the super access card she said, what is the urgency of this hotel putting card reader on the elevator, if some guests can access to entire floor!? Looking that the debate didn't going good for her, she offered, ""it is okay sir not to pay the bills if you feel reluctant to these stuffs."" Well well well....
Then i told them to prepare the bills immediately, yet they still begging sorry, and kept saying no problem for me not to take the bills. I told them that i always pay the bill for things I ate or drinks!
The bill was input and i went to lobby to settle everything.

Pros:
1. Nice bathtub
2. Stable hot water

Cons:
1. Small king size bed

5. Bad bathroom design (the spilled water from the bathtub cannot be dried completely after a night)

Set up room service deposit so I don't need to worry about going out of the room for meals and payment hassles for both me and my colleague. My colleague had to pay for breakfast since the deposit ran out, and I was instructed by the front office to come down, refill the deposit at front office, then go up again to my room in order to continue using room service. Doesn't make sense. Had to pay in cash for my room service breakfast as well, and the waiter while leaving reminded me as well to come down and settle my deposit as no more room service available until I do, making me regret giving him a tip. When I checked in last night was prepared to give a larger deposit but front office only requested half of what I proposed. Only after that front office called up and said their manager approved of all remaining payments (room service) to be settled during check out. Unfortunately the damage has been done and my mood has been altered, making my stay unpleasant. Will be checking out on time and not having any more meals here as I don't want to spend anymore of my money on this hotel. This all is on top of the poor WIFI (couldn't connect) and only 2 elevators working for both guests, service and towards the parking lot, causing a lack in security since no need to use keycard to reach guest room floors, so basically anyone can reach ang floor.

We actually wanted to go out of town but unlucky for us its the holidays and hotel prices have jumped. We've stayed at a couple of 5 or 4 star hotels in Surabaya booked, but haven't tried Ciputra world yet and since we wanted to watch Star Wars and the Mall is right next to it we thought it was a good idea. To be honest we had high hopes with the service, I called before checking in to confirm my booking and to get a room with 1 bed, once I got there they said it was full and I could get a 1 bed room with an upgrade of 200.000, then when we got to the room well it was nice.. luxury.. but average, it wasn't a wow for us. the worst thing is the bathroom. Well everything looked spotless clean, but it smelled like piss so bad.. at first I thought it was my husband but when I asked he said he hasn't taken a pee yet. the good thing is when I complained they cleaned it straight away.. another thing is .. I don't know if it was just me, or maybe others felt it too, but I felt a little discrimination from the employees, you could really feel it when they look at you in a way.. well my husband and I like to dress casual, and we are locals and native, I truly feel that the employees should not treat guest from appearance, at first I kept it to myself, then at night after watching star wars at 9pm and finished at around 11 we went to the hotel via lift to hotel lobby in 1am .. near where our car was parked, to find the glass door was locked. so we were kind of confused and driver out to the lobby and asked I think it was the bell boy or security I don't know, I went in and asked, 'Mas, mau tanya.. saya td parkir di 1A and pintu lift ke lobbynya dikunci' he immediately said I remember he said it fast as fast as he was judging me 'parkir motor?' I answered still patiently 'mobil mas'.. I mean there could be a nicer way to ask that.. like ""mohon maaf ibu kendaraannya apa boleh saya tau? "" that would sound polite and not judgmental.. hopefully they will be better trained in the future.. at least not judge people so quickly, I might be a nobody who just likes to enjoy 5 star hotels... but next time.. you never know who your guest are..

The swimming pool needs more chair, please. The guard wasn't so nice as well, she saw me carrying my baby while waiting for my toddler and husband for a swim with backpack and a lot of stuff in my hands, had nowhere to seat and they don't even bother to offer a chair, not so nice at all.

I wait for 30 minutes after reception serve them.

I feel bad. And I get upgrade room (actually, I didn't need for that. I need best hospitality from Ciputra Hotel Surabaya). The hotel should ask me for email my voucher hotel to email him.

In the morning, I called at 8.15am for ask the iron because I was looking for the iron and hanger not there in  clothes closet room's 1711. 

Hotel Ciputra is 5 stars and...The facilities aren't complete.

And The Hotel give me free for 2 pieces press my clothes. BUT The room service came after 31 minutes. Zzzzzzzzzz I was late for massage.

The hotel doesn't have business room for public, usual as 5 stars hotel others. I want to check in my reservation airline. The hotel only can print boarding pass, It can't help me for check in.

The air conditioner is not functioning optimally even the mechanic has repaired it many times. The Receptionist suggested moving rooms, but there was no solution. The air conditioner is still not cold. Hot water is not functioning optimally. Technician had already repaired it, but only warm. Every day the room key is always error. I had to call and wait for the hotel to open the door. Even though the master key from the hotel also doesn't work. During our stay, there was no response and fast handling from the hotel that could solve our problem everyday. Thank You DoubleTree by Hilton Surabaya",Holiday
125725399,9000000332323,Rendy T. ,6.5,"Let's start with good points first. Good room. Nice and clean, big and spacious. Free cookies from check in, tasty. And I will point out needs improvement things from here: 1. Parking building lift. I got stuck not only once but twice. Once when I came for check in, and once again 2 days later when I checked out. Luckily the lift door still open and I can came out from it and took stairs. 2. Check in experience, need a lot of improvement if I don't want to say it's terrible. Booked 2 rooms with separate booking. Confirmed only confirmed 1. Need to give my booking detail to get the second room confirmed. I booked 2 different rooms, deluxe which bigger and standard room, an d they said they only had smoking floor available for me to stay. I refused because I travel with my pregnant wife, 5 y.o. Kid, also my mom and dad. I told them please arrange to put us on no smoking floor, even if I must downgrade my deluxe room to standard. They kept checking and came with solution that I got the same room as I booked in non smoking floor, BUT twin bed that cannot be pushed to become 1 big bed, not king sized bed as I booked. Of course I declined and I insisted that I need non smoking floor, king sized bed. I already gave up my deluxe room but they still reluctant to address my need. Check in experience took me about 45 minutes, but in the end we get the non smoking, standard, king sized room. For 5 star hotel, this is the worst check in experienced I've ever had. 3. Breakfast variation is good, but not hit my taste bud. Sorry for that. 4. Swimming pool, not appropriate for 5 star hotel. Too small. 5. Amenities, for 2 person room, they only provide 1 slipper, 1 toothbrush and toothpaste. Please put attention on these details, because you're 5 star hotel. 6. Last but not least, hotel building lift. Very very slow and super small. Please upgrade. We feel like using lift in 3 star hotel. Overall experience, 5 out of 10. Will not come back to stay here in Surabaya if they don't make improvement.

But overall, I like staying and spending my weekend here. The bedroom is nice. I really like the heavy banquet so it’s perfectly wrapped and make myself warm during night. One thing that DoubleTree should be paying attention to, is the breakfast time. I didn't see any gloves provided by the staff. Guest could easily take the food without any gloves on, and with this pandemic situation, I felt unsafe and insecure to eat. Even though hand sanitizer are nearby, but still….

We just got our room after waiting for about 1,5 hours. My husband was so disappointed at the service provided by them at that time and raised his voice out of anger at one of the receptionists but she didn't handle it very well and accused my husband of saying some curse words (which my husband did not say).

126014592,9000000803922,Hendri F. ,6,"Initially our expectations were quite high for a Westin-class hotel service, but we were disappointed after experiencing the following events: 1. We ordered a H-2 week hotel by ordering 1 large bed, with a city view, but on the D day, the big bed ran out, we were offered twin bed with fixed city view, or large non city view bed. And finally we decided on a non-city view big bed and no bathtub. So dissapointing. Failed all our plans! 2. We purposely asked for a request for decorations for a birthday that night, but with the room change incident above, the decorations didn't exist because we decided to take a large bed (decorations were prepared in the twin bed room), oh yes. The funny thing is, the name of the birthday cake is wrong. sob. Failing to make good memories on birthdays, is very unpleasant. 3. We entered room 2912, the room was comfortable clean and cold, until finally we tried to use the toilet but fatally, the toilet washer didn't work! Lucky we only (sorry) pee, what if we pooped! We immediately called the receptionist and sent a technician, sure enough, the washer had a problem and had to be replaced. We, who were quite tired and wanted to rest, had to wait for the change for about 20 minutes. Huh. 4. We stayed at the Westin hoping to rest well. But suddenly at 10.45 on Sunday while we were taking a break the door bell rang, I opened it, it turned out to be a room boy who asked if we ordered luggage down or not? Of course not! 5 star class hotels can miss communication with room number problems. omg! 5. We were not informed that the parking problem must be stamped first at the receptionist, ok. This hotel is in a mall and if you don't ask for a hotel stamp, you will be subject to a stay fine, but shouldn't this be informed up front? So that we don't have to walk to the gate first, be confused and surprised by the parking attendant, then turn back to the hotel and ask for a stamp. 6. This is a subjective opinion, maybe yes. Because of the many incidents above, but we feel that all of the staff, especially the receptionists, lack information, and are not helpful, yes, those two. Please differentiate between being unhelpful and impolite, if there is no problem with our politeness and communication methods. Overall, we will not recommend this 5 stars hotel to our friends, family or collages, we pay for a 5 star hotel (weekend rate) in the hope that the service is good and comfortable. Anyways. There are still many 5-star hotels in Surabaya that are better in terms of facilities and services. Sorry Westin. Very disappointing!",Holiday

The Staff was not friendly at all, I have been staying at 5 stars hotel frequently , so I know the standard of hospitality from 5 stars hotel, The security and the front liner not smiling at all or greeting us. They just check our temperature, open the door and ignore us. Not offering us to help our luggage. 2. FD is helpful, however I got a room where there was connecting door , unfortunately their noise can be heard to our room until late night. please consider if you want to stay here with connecting door and there is another guest 3. The room was clean, but the problem came out, when I opened the blanket and I saw the bed sheet was so messy , until I need to ask the room service , whether the bed sheet was changed after another guest checked out, but he convinced me that the bed sheet was changed. commonly when I stay at 5 star hotel it would be neat and I will assuredly that the bed sheet is changed. 4. I had dinner at their lounge, however the knowledge of their staff was so miserable, everytime I asked something about the menu, she always answered with "" Sorry, I don't know "" even asking the juice is fresh or chilled, she didn't understand. Please, Sangrila, I know Covid really impact to your hotel and maybe you need to cut off your employee , but please at least hire a person who really capable of F&B.

There are some quests who sneeze and cough while taking the food without a mask. The swimming pool was too full too. Indeed, since the first time, the size of the Vasa swimming pool did not match the number of the rooms. Automatically guests will look like ice cendol during a long vacation.

120387887,3000010028502,Arif G.,6,"Check in quite unsatisfying, because of some reason: 1. I arrived and stepped in this lobby hotel around 11.32 AM. One of the girl at the front desk (check-in desk) who supposed to smile and greet me at the very first time, but she did not do it at all. The hotel management should replace her with one with smiling and at least can say a greeting word to welcome the guest (at least me, I did not hear the greeting from this girl). 2. The check in process was terrible. It took a very long time. She asked me the proof of my booking at Traveloka, which then I gave her. It was ok. Then she looked at the screen of her computer clicked mouse and hit the keyboard. She also asked my ID Card, which I also gave her. It was normal. ok. All the process were normal. What was abnormal was the speed of the process, and her face which really was not friendly, and her face showed look likely she was reluctant to do the work. She needed around 10 minutes to do the process, even though, it turned up not final process. G**h....! 3. After doing input the data of me, then she asked my credit card to open a guarantee for my stay, and asked me to sign it. To me, it was terrible. I already paid the 2 nights stay in this hotel, in full amount, through app. Why this hotel asked me for more, my credit card, as a guarantee ?! It was ridiculous, especially when you then found that in the bedroom there was no items for sale. Did the hotel think that the guests are all thief, or worry that the guests will do in-room service without paying for it, or worry that all the guests will take the hotel's amenities (towel, pictures, pillow, blanket etc. ?!) illegally? It is unacceptable to me. But, eventually, I gave my credit card for this, reluctantly. All the process, including this opening the credit card for guarantee, took around 15 minutes. It was already 11.49 AM. 4. The story has not.stopped there. After all of these disturbing thing, then she told me to sit down in the lobby lounge's sofa while waiting for her to settle my check in process. It could be because I arrived earlier that day (at around 11.32 AM) that she needed to find a room available to me. If that was the case, then what she needed to do was just inform me, then I would sure I would have understood. 5. Knowing that the process will take a very long time, I told her (the girl at front desk), that I need to do Shalat Jumat at nearby mosque. After finishing my Friday Prayer, I returned to the hotel, at around 12.47 PM. She then threw my check-in process to her colleague, a man officer. Still, the man asked me my ID Card. With this man, it took another 2-3 minutes before he gave me the room key. 6. All together, the check in process (including the time I spent for Friday Prayers), took 1 hour and 18 minutes. Of course, you can omit/disregard the time I spent for Friday Prayer, which was around 1 hour. The remaining time is 20 minutes. Still, 20 minutes (+ approx 10-15 minutes waiting time if I waited in the hotel's lobby instead of went Friday Prayer) is too long for a check in process. 7. The good side of this Vasa Hotel was, the menu for breakfast was ok. You can find western style breakfast, or continental breakfast (Hong Kong / Guangdong Style fried rice, plain porridge, etc). 8. The check out process was relatively better. Faster compared to check-in process. Oh yes, I've only stayed 1,5 days of my stay, means I checked-out at 16.00 PM on 9 March 2019 (20 hours in advance from my scheduled check out time, instead of 12.00PM in 10 March), because of personal reason. 9. For sure, I will not stay in this hotel again in the future, and I will not recommend this hotel to my colleague to stay. This hotel, in my humble opinion, is not worthy to money I spent. 10. I do advice the management of this hotel to: a. Improve the standard of service to the guests. b. Speed up the check-in and check-out process. c. Give a little respect to the guests. d. Train the front desk officer to improve their communication skill. e. Consider not to give burden to the guests by providing guarantee money, or opening credit card account, especially for those guests who have already paid all the room charge in full, using online reservation.Good luck, Vasa Hotel !",Business travel

The guest relation and concierge was very very friendly and helpful too. BUT, the front office staffs wasn't really gave me satisfying services. They did the standard communications but I can feel they didn't do it with all their heart. Sometimes being unrespectful and even the woman who helped me check out was disrecpectfully throw the room card in front of me. I never get this kind of services in this hotel before.

I was stay in some 5 stars hotel such Marriot or Hilton in Indonesia and I was stay in some hotels in Europe or Africa or Asia but for the first time in my life that borrow the plate from restaurant at hotel is charged. And the reason behind this charging according to reception is the management hotel doesn’t want to clean those dish which used for food from outside. They have busy enough to clean the dish from their restaurant. That was made me disappointed. The room are good. I got the corner. But the water in bathroom are too slow. The hot water come after 10 minutes waiting. The food okay. I like the variants they have and that's really ok. But I will rethink if I want to stay in this hotel again.

In the lobby, they did not even ask for our vaccination certificate nor they ask us to log in to our pedulilindungi apps. When we enter the room they did not seal the room like the same practice with any other hotel around the world. The most idiotic is when we ordered room service they came to our room with the food uncovered with wrapping paper and wide open from the kitchen located on the lower level and our room is on the 21st floor. They don't control the numbers of people with the same elevators, in one case I have to be packed with 8 people and one of them stupidly did not use a mask. FYI they open 100 % reservations. I know because I asked the front desk. Knowing the pandemic is still here hotels and accommodations must pay attention to jow they serve. I won't recommend people to stay at this hotel.

They said that I would need to wait about an hour. 40 minutes later, I came up to them, saying that if they decided to give that guest the late check-out privilege, the least they can do is consider the check-in time for me, since for all I know, a hotel room should be ready at 3 PM at the latest. Then they decided to give me an upgrade, which I refused, because the upgraded room was an apartment-concept-room and doesn't come with a bath-tub. Around 5 PM, I came up to the reception again, asking how long should I wait for my room to be ready, and only then that they offered me a transit room. But before I got to refuse the transit room (it would be a whole lot of effort to change rooms for just under an hour), another staff came and told me the room was ready, minus the towels and mini bar snacks. So I asked them for the key and chose to wait for the towel and mini bar snacks in my room. Before I went to bed, I decided to draw myself a hot bath, but the water was cold. Had to wait a few minutes for it to turn warm (warm, not hot) with a really low debit of water. I tried turning the tab to get a higher debit of water, but then the temperature will drop to ice cold water. Called the operator, the technician came to my room about 15 minutes later.

As we checked in we informed of the Accor Membership.  On 24th we had gone to a fruit store and made some fruit baskets to bring to families during visits and my wife bought some durian and we ate it along with Surabaya Family at the 5th floor (pool open area). Where we had our Christmas Eve Dinner. (Check for 6 people dinner bill was around 1.5 million, lady was nice and even gave me 15% disc). During check out today morning they charged us Rp 1 Million Rupiah for eating durian in room, I clearly told them we didn't eat in room but at 5th floor where people drink smoke etc one guy during check out was quiet but the one that handled our check out wasn't corporative. So is this the way Novotel make additional money?  I didn't want to argue as I was in a hurry (didn't even have breakfast at the hotel) as I had a flight to Jakarta early this morning and moreover I have a babygirl of 1 1/2 years old for which I booked a connecting room but on arrival with 30 minutes argument with front desk only they gave me a connecting room, that too I had to wait.  I understand that durians are a problem in many places but we have brains and would not eat them in the room. If there are any personal out of the box rules they should have been informed at check in. I personally do smoke too and do it outside the lobby or open area 5th floor. Our extra check out charge was around 1.060.000.. the 60.000 was for a laundry bill for pressing 3 shirts which is usually even a free service in most hotels. It is not the matter of Rp 1.000.000 but if I did eat durian in the room or lobby I don't mind the charge, I had my Christmas Eve dinner at the pool bar and had it there. All your lower staff are good nice and fair, so many times I requested restaurant to warm my baby's porridge, they were very helpful, but the top staff have their nose up in the air and think they can do anything due to their position. I am sure Novotel will be very well protected by their legal team and my wife must have signed below your fine print before check in, this is a trap and scam for customers.

However in this case, I can instantly smelled the smoke odour as soon as I opened the door. Fortunately, on the next morning, they managed to move us to a non-smoking room as we were complaining about the smoke odour again.

They just called me after they let him go with the keys, “Hi mba, mau info aja tadi ada mas yang dateng bilang sama mba jadi saya kasih issue room key tambahan buat dia”.

We went to The Deckside Lounge to get some beers to discover the prices were highly inflated. The beer prices were 4 times what we normally pay and service charges and tax was not included in the advertisement price. We paid 290,000 for 2 small Bintang Beers and 2 small Guinness beers. This morning we went to the restaurant to have breakfast and were told our breakfast was not included which I queried. We decided to have breakfast and it was very average, not would I expect from a hotel of this standard.

However, if there's anything wrong with the room, it's probably the bed and the view. To be fair, the view from the room is not something that you can do anything about, but if the hotel is not fully occupied, I believe that you guys can do better than assigning me a room with a window overlooking two water tanks of the neighbor's building. As for the bed, I couldn't remember how it was the first time I stayed here, but I couldn't help but notice that this time your double bed was simply two single beds joined and wrapped with a king-size sheet. Sleeping with my wife and a two-year old daughter in this bed sure was not that comfortable when you could feel the the joining part of the beds on your back. However, what was most disappointing to me was the breakfast. The fresh milk had an acidic and sour flavor, which made me wonder if it were indeed fresh. The sight of the restaurant employees playing with their mobile phones while on duty sure was not something I would describe as professional.

I ordered the standard room which has separated shower room, toilet room, and hand basin. The size of each shower, toilet and hand basin room is comfortable enough for a person to use. It is neither too big nor too narrow. They have some good selection of foreign and local TV channel for us to watch. The bed is completed with pillow and bolster which I rarely find in other hotel. The lighting is not too bright and also not too dark. If you plan to visit Surabaya and want to have a nice rest in a room without too much decoration or gimmick, Harris Hotel is definitely the choice.

The manager offered to give me a separate bowl of meat… but I was already filled up with satay instead. The ribs with sweet soy sauce was excellent. Health protocols were great including the strict limit on pool attendance. Interiors & exteriors, probably the best in Bandung area… 👍🏼.

I couldn't understand how they can get a good review or call themselves a 4-star hotel while in actual the rooms we're checked in appeared to be heavily mis-maintenanced. We booked a Premiere Room with bathtub. What we got was a room with condition worse than a hostel room. Room size: as small as a budget hotel's room, located at 2nd floor north tower with neigborhood's houses as its outside view. Very little space between the bed and the walls, even the sofa appeared to be squeezed in between the bed and wall. Cleanliness: wall peeled off, dirts all over the sofa and carpets, with carpet itself are full of stains. The curtain is dusty with dark soot, its rail is misaligned. Sofa is stained. We found there's also remains of coffee stained on the mug plate that wasn't cleaned off. Tables are heavily stained, and there're paint stain on the back of the chair. Waterspot on the bathroom taps and sink are clearly visible. Moss can be found on every corner of the bathroom wall. When we enters the room, it smells like an old empty house. Surely we requested to be moved to better room. Responded within 1 hour and we were moved to 9th floor on the same tower. Room looks better even though clearly it is not maintained properly. So many stains on the carpet, moss on the bathroom, shower's leaking when turned on. And when we moved the sofa, we found food remains underneath it on the carpet. Fantastic. Amenities: only bath towels provided and they smell not good. Tissue only provided on the bathroom. Security: anyone without access card can enter the north tower and ride the elevators. Lighting: the room ambiance is so dark. Food: Food just taste not too good. Positive: children can play with animals on the rooftop. Strategic location. Definitely will not come back here anymore.",Staycation

Egg station, pasta station and chicken station with only one person in charge? Then your guests are waitin' for a long time... The chicken meat for the porridge was still red.

126070207,3000010008390,cindy k.,5.5,"Few things to note, I stayed for 2 nights in the superior twin room around new year’s eve so it was pretty much a high season (not so packed) in this hotel. Right from I arrived, it was okay with the hospitality from the staff (the trolley was available, the check in was easy, the staff were helpful etc.). Then I proceed to the parking lot and they told me they have secure parking behind the main tower which I found it interesting that the parking lot itself was quite small compared to the size of the hotel. It didn’t bother me though so I thought it was understandable. The main areas and hallway could use some cleaning and repainting but still looks a little bit decent. Now here comes the main reason why I gave the rate of 1 star in here. When I entered my room, I noticed too many stain on the wall, the floor (not carpeted) still have the leftovers + dust from the previous guest on the furniture, the color of the pillow cases is dirty from previous stain without proper cleaning, the pillow itself is deflated. Bed sheet and quilt cover have stain. The furniture needs replacement and the ceiling have molds. I did not even bother to touch the kettle given the condition of the room, I would prefer get my morning coffee or tea elsewhere. Called the front office many times asking to replace the sheet, pillow, quilt etc. (No sorry whatsoever) up until I could not stand it and asked for a room replacement and even a refund eventually. They offered to move me to another (which have even worse condition) and I refused because I thought whats the point if its worse than my current room. Then I asked to cancel my second night booking and asked for a refund. As you may expect, they did not want to refund and won’t even offer any option to upgrade or anything. So given the time of my stay was new year’s eve, I have no choice but to stay. The facilities like the pool and kids playground are supposed to be the main entertainment but turned out to be really dirty and it was at 8pm the playground was already close it means that they did not clean after being used. Moreover, it has molds in the air conditioner duct, mold in the bathroom tiles, and (here comes the best part) hot water was not functioning. Called the technician and all he said was the guests in the whole building were using the hot water at the same time so I needed to choose different time to take a shower and it was like 8 am in the morning. I did not mind of all the problems I have described if I don't need to pay around IDR 900k ++ and if they do not claim (or self proclaimed) the hotel to be 4-star.",Holiday

A bit late, they handed the laundry bag, but I was already disappointed. 15mins policy is not fulfilled. On the evening, the TV channel turn to being funny.

121625815,295675,Riki A.,10,"We stayed in Ibis Trans Studio last weekend and overall it was a pleasant experience. There are things need to be highlighted: Plus 1. Location This is the main strength point of Ibis Trans Studio. It's located in Gatot Subroto next to Trans Luxury Hotel and Trans Studio Mall which will be the attracting feature for travelers from other cities. The location itself is accessible by many transportation modes and particularly easy to reach from Bandung Train Station 2. Hospitality The hotel staffs are kind and helpful. They are very polite in serving their guests. On the day we arrived at Ibis Trans Studio, we were 2 hours earlier from their check in clock. However, they were eager to check on any available room. Once they found one, they informed us and let us to enter the room to rest. That means a lot to us. 3. Breakfast Quality breakfast with both western and Indonesian food. They serve breakfast from 6 am and even earlier on special occasion (special request) Minus 1. Room key They used digital room key for guests to access particular floor and room. However, many guests (myself included) found difficulties in accessing their floor and room. They need to ask receptionist for replacement many times. My suggestion for Ibis is they might want to think to switch their digital key to the tapped model. Last time I checked they still used the plug-in model. 2. Lack of amenities Unlike other 3-star-above hotels, they decides to provide minimum number of amenities. During our stay, we only got pair of soaps and shower cap. They did provide the tooth paste on request and I found this a little bit odd. Also, pair of cotton buds wouldn't hurt, eh? 3. Parking Basements Since the parking basements are a joint parking among Ibis, Trans Luxury, and TSM, it's a little bid confusing at the first time to park our car. The Ibis parking area is a little bit hidden and we spent half an hour just to park our car. Overall, it was a pleasant stay. I will definitely stay there again. Ibis, in general, never fails me.",Family vacation

At the same time, many guests were treated just like us, even my friends got the room at 6 p.m. Bad crowd happened at the Lobby, then they gave us free dinner as the compliment.
But what happened after that was a disaster!!!
we entered the Mosaic Restaurant at 6.30 p.m, ordered the food just like normal customers, guess when our food came to our table?
at 8.30 p.m!! and it was not all of our orders.. the food served one by one. At the end, one of my friend didn't get his food, because they ran out of meat! it was the best nightmare ever!
fyi, my friend put his order directly to the Restaurant Director, but it never came out. The Director said sorry about it and offered my friend with other menu, but dude, it was 9.30 p.m!! You made him lose his appetite! You made our children and my friend starved!! this is the worst 5 stars hotel we ever stayed!
We are 6 adults with 6 small kids, we booked 3 rooms, and treated like trash.
I recommended Crowne Plaza to my friends so they agreed to book the same hotel with me, but we harvested trash!!

Breakfast was NOT good (BAD), only serve a few selection of food and drink.

The room look is nice but the balcony door broken and aircon is not cool (because not a central aircon like a real 4-star hotel).

Instead of moving us to a new room they said let us try to fix it.

How do you feel spending not a small amount of money to stay at a 4 star hotel, and seeing a maintenance guy fixing broken stuff inside the room?

One more thing, the place is too noisy. Can you please stop doing all the maintenance when there are customer in the next door? I can't enjoy the day with all that sound (hammer something into a wall, screwdriver machine etc.)

Please don't show this as a 4 star hotel.",Family vacation
125012199,3000010040418,Trisna K.,5.3,"Far from expectations of a 4 stars hotel that is said to be ""luxury"" 🙂 Early check-in was really long, I was given only 1 key even though access to the lift was also using a key. So if my husband went out for work, how about me and the kids inside the room if we only have 1 keycard? The hotel should give us 2 keys from the start instead of asking for a deposit money of the 2nd key. Why make everything so complicated? Although the deposit only 50k.🙂 The hotel says there is a telephone repair, so for room service you can communicate via WhatsApp chat, and the service took so long. Turns out the phone line broken since January. So it wasn't because there was a repair.🙂 Then, when I was inside my hotel room there was no mat and when I take shower, water enters the bedroom through the gap in the toilet door. This thing happened because of the toilet door design failed. This makes the floor of the room slippery.🙂 Some of the part of the walls in the toilet were a lot of moss. The same as the wall around the Jacuzzi which was on the tenth floor.🙂 The room is too narrow for a size of a deluxe double. And the bathroom really is a disaster. 🙂 There is no mirror around the dresser, so if you want to have a makeup, you have to stand in front of the coffe maker because the only mirror I can find inside the room was on top of the coffee maker.🙂 The worst thing is about the internet. If I want to use internet, I have to turn ON the TV all the time, so what if it's time for bed, my child wants to sleep, but I still need internet because I still need to work? So absurd! 🙂 Water inside the pool is dirty especially the jacuzzi and the water filter doesn't work.🙂 The floor around the pool is very slippery especially people who wear sandals from the hotel. Not only me, but several other visitors almost fell in the swimming pool area, because of the slippery floor. 🙂 This so called ""4 star luxury"" should understand about safety and comfort for their visitors. Why not install an anti-slippery mat? I'm sure they can afford it, especially the rate of staying at the hotel per-night is over priced. 🙂 The service system at the pool also needs to be changed. Besides there is no supervisor, they also have no dry pool towel service in the pool area. 🙂 Hotel provides 2 towels for swimming inside the room. After the towels are used by visitors, it must be brought into the room. If I used it in the morning and in the afternoon, the towels are wet already. And the next morning we asked for new towels, but we waited too long so we re-used the wet towels again and again. 🙂 At breakfast, everything is okay, the food is good, the hotel runs the covid protocol well. Yesterday we had breakfast buffett. 🙂 Me and the kids don't intend to spent the night at this hotel ever again. This hotel is not recommended at all for staying. Staycation at this hotel was one of my worst experience for so called ""4 stars hotel luxury"" 🙂 This hospitality management hotel needs to learn more to serve visitors well and improve the quality of the hotel so that the hotel becomes better.🙂",Staycation

Second problem is The room is not sound proof, is beside the road and there is a lot of motorcycle passing by, every time they pass i car hear clearly the motor sound, and sometimes its so loud it wake me up from my sleep, i can even hear the neighbour rooms conversation faintly. The third problem is they start renovating the room in 8.30 in morning, i can't event get enough sleep last night because all of the noise, and now they wake me up in 8.30 with drilling, hammering and sawing sounds, although it stops in 15 mins after i make complain, but i have already awake and it's hard to get back to sleep, and they start the noise again in half hour after they stop.... For me, this hotel is only looks good is pics, with fancy decoration, but it got all the problems in cheap hotel. Frankly said i can get better sleep in 3 star hotel rather than paying more then 2 million rupiah for this. The normal room might be a good deal in the price, with all this problems they have, but The jaccuzzi room is really overprice, really good in editing the pictures.

As for our room, our bed sheet had some stain in it, the shower handle was rusty and some parts already broken, and the chair was not very safe to be seated as my wife was almost fell of when trying to seat comfortably there. During this pandemic, there was no changes in the breakfast buffet method. Yes, we were being asked for what time slot to eat, but apparently other guest from other time slot can still come and eat in our breakfast time. So...? Also, we need to pick our food by ourselves and not by the staff. The staff, btw, were not very friendly and helpful. They didn't offer to brought us coffee/tea/snacks (usually other hotel staff would offer that, given that we have a toddler to watch). Also, when I asked for a new sunny side up, the staff said I could take the ready one (which was not warm anymore so I had no appetite to finish it).

Been curious for so long for this hotel, unfortunately we had more bad experience instead of the good ones. First, check in was not smooth. I have to wait until 30 minutes since the room was not ready. Second, they only gave one room card and for the second card we have to deposit by cash. No other option. Third, concierge staff is not friendly and also not informative. Fourth, phone in our room is not working so we have to use whatsapp which is not effective, since they are slow respond. Fifth, no greeter in the pool and no pool towels . When we ask the staff, they asked us to bring and use our room towels. Sixth, I also put special request ‘celebrate birthday’ when booking the room, and they are not capturing our request. Besides all bad experience we have, breakfast was great and the rooftop view is amazing.

I told him the payment can be charged into my room bill and I will pay once I check out but he refused. I was terribly disappointed because it's not the policy which informed earlier.

The food was good with many choices, but the restaurant were small and packed. We arrived there at around 2pm with no parking slot, they only have 20 parking slots for 150s rooms. So we have to use valet service while we’re there. We have to wait for 5-10mins every time we’re going out. The valet staff apparently play the radio while parking our car cause the radio setting changed. Because of their “24 hours stayed” concept , no rooms were ready when we arrived. They have to wait for other guest to check-out. They let us waited for about 30mins without complimentary nor welcome drinks. And it’s 30 mins only because we asked with initiative. We get room with poor view and quite small space. The cleanliness were very disappointing. We found spots on bed sheet and on 3 towels, lips stain on glasses, there’s even water inside 2 of them.

I asked roomboy if I can add 1 more pillow and 1 more bath towel. He said it was charge 15.000 each. I said okay, and I asked for the bill and want to charge it to my room. He said cash only. (?) why? I'll be willing to add deposit at the reception if it was the problem. And for the record, I did ask the reception if I have to add some deposit. Reception said didn't have to.

Bad experienced came on my last night to stay from Aston Tropicana's security staff (as the Hotel Manager's advice these security has already same level as Supervisor).
These guys embarrassed me with impolite attitude which suppose not came from the hospitality business staff.
I went back to the hotel around 11pm with my friends who drive me using the motorcycle, he just dropped me but not come with me to the lobby hotel. When i walked to the lobby, these security came to me and ask me with impolite gestured.. he asked where i want to go, i said to get in..he asked me again to which room, i advice my room number xxx and i can't acceptable any longer with his impoliteness..i advice him..""i stay here, what's your problem? Do you think that i am hockers?"" I am very angry about this and unacceptable in any manners.
And he advice me..he doesn't think like these..he'd advice me that he thought that I am Online massage therapist...(i am very speechless with his comments!).
And it's same with me that I am speechless when I know the hotels managers has already knew about these issue when he came to the office in the next day AM time but he not come to my room or at least call me to say apologize. 
He just say apologize when the checkout time and i asked to FOC staff that i want to meet the Duty Manager.
Whats going on with these hotel staff? They need these Hotel Group trained their staff for the manners for all staff. I never get these experience in any group's hotel and in any cities.

Asked them to fix the AC but they did little to nothing. Breakfast was so so. Little parking space. Covid protocol was terrible, most of the guests did not wear any mask in lobby and restaurant. Sad sad stay. We actually booked for Two nights, but only stayed for one, got the second night refunded and moved to a better hotel. It ' s very unfortunate because this hotel used to be very Good. Used to stay here few years ago and it was very pleasing, but not this time. Sad to see what happened to this hotel. In 2016/17 the room here used to cost around $ 70-$100/night now it only costs $ 35, half the price. Judging by that I can clearly say it ' s because of the degradation of quality. Maybe because of pandemic? We'll never know. If you want a pleasant stay for/under $ 50, I suggest look for newer modern hotels to stay like Moxy hotel, hotel 101 or any other budget hotel.

In the first day I had breakfast at the hotel restaurant I ordered my favorite drink is Chocolates milkshake and the taste was good but my nightmare is coming in the 2nd day I had breakfast on Tuesday 29 Of May when I ordered again my favorite drink is chocolates milkshakes.  The hotel staff mixing liquid soap to wash dishes to my chocolates milkshakes accidentally he said because his co-worker put dishwasher plastic bottle in the beverage maker without any name Label because GM Horison hotel seminyak Mrs. Dahlia Panjaitan has admitted mistakes that have been done her hotel staff restaurant Horison seminyak bali and also about the negligence of forgetting to give a name on plastic bottle dish laundry. I’m sadly disappointed to Mrs.dahlia panjaitan as GM Horison hotel seminyak had time who only given paper containing the action to people who exposed to toxins like me when I drink Chocolate milkshake from restaurant hotel. Finally she’s ( Hotel GM ) decided to send me to Siloam hospital in sunset road area. The hotel gave a deposit to the hospital for my inpatient room, medicines only for 2 days and for my blood test, stomach and other checks to confirms if there was no danger because when at the hotel restaurant I could Vomit all the times. I’m feeling sad and more disappointed when GM Horison hotel seminyak and also her hotel staff leaving me alone unaccompanied in the hospital even they also already know from me if all my families in Jakarta. The hotel also did not call the hospital to inquire about my condition until I finally decided not to stay overnight in the hospital and back to the hotel by taxi and paid myself in the hotel.  When I returned to the hotel also I felt the hotel staff’s acted like nothing happened. Some of the hotel staff asked me about my condition but very funny because Mrs.dahlia panjaitan as Hotel GM never met me or call to my hotel room to asked my condition since I’m back from hospital a few days ago after the incident until I finally said loudly asking about it to the some of the hotel staff’s and also I said to them if GM hotel do not have a brain because she’s only ask her staff hotel to ask about my condition every time I met them in restaurant area. After my reactions finally GM hotel meet me while I was sitting in the pool bar with new friend from Bali as grab driver who I know when I was ordered grab  Mrs.dahlia panjaitan ask my condition and we talked a lot. She’s met me again the next morning when I had breakfast with my other new friend from Jakarta also but Mrs.dahlia panjaitan not met me again when today ( 4 Of June 2018 ) I check out and because the trauma I also never ordered chocolates milkshakes to the hotel since I’m back and check out of the hotel.  My last advice to Mrs.Dahlia panjaitan as GM Horison hotel seminyak please be more professional and considerate to the local tourists who staying in Horison hotel seminyak bali and also more attention to make a name in the liquid bottle for laundry and the label name for liquid sugar so there will be no victim like me. One more to remind you if your hotel receptionist know very well if I did upgrade full payment my room to pool view when I check in on Sunday 27 Of May 2018 and you know also very well if I’m not asked the hotel anything about the incident.  Thanks for Horison Hotel seminyak bali which has ruined my holiday in Bali and for sure I will not stay in this hotel anymore and also after I back to the hotel from hospital if international tourists in the hotel doesn’t like me without reasons A.K.A they seems hate me but it’s ok because they don’t know the fact if I’m as the Horison Hotel seminyak bali victim and the hotel already acknowledges the mistakes they have made.",Shopping & Culinary

Poor security behavior management I was driving my car through the basement parking, during inclining, the car was suddenly made a jolted stop and I could not restart despite how many times I tried. I was shocked as the thought something was wrong with the engine and quickly got out and checked around. Surprisingly, it was because an idle wooden wheel chock lying there. What’s more to it, the security ignorantly didn’t do anything. 2. Breaching of customer privacy right. My parents were staying next door within the connecting room. Once morning, I heard he screamed and shockingly yelled to someone. I stormed at the door and my dad angrily explained that a guy from housekeeping opened the door out of nowhere while my mother was at the shower. While it’s true, few minutes ago, he made a call for facial tissue and was at the toilet when the bell rang. 3. Ignorant manager on duty My parents tried to communicate the issues to their superior but instead of apologizing, assistant manager (MOD) named Adhi only said that it was miss communication. We left the hotel speechlessly thinking in what world it can be miss communication. That’s basic SOP that you need to make a call first to the room when customers do not respond after ringing the bell/knocking by the door. I did not recommend this hotel even some says it’s good for location and price.

When we first got into the room the AC broke and we have to call the technician who takes like 2 hours before it started working normally.

Our luggage still sitting pretty at the corner. The service is bad. When you call the receptionist you will not get what you asked for.

Room was nice but under the bed was dirty with dust, it seems room cleaning just dusted all the dust under the bed and did not vacuum it.

Bed was rocking don’t know why maybe one if the legs was not even, so will tell housekeeping to sort this problem out as we still have 2 more nights to stay. We just arrived yesterday afternoon.

Thumbs up for all the staffs that are super polite, friendly, and helpful. The room is spacious with an oversized king bed that probably can accommodate up to 4 people and the deluxe premiere has a direct access to the hotel garden which is great. I couldn't find any food menu in the room but it wasn't a problem since the hotel is surrounded by many restaurants. The only thing that bugged me about this hotel is the bathroom. It has a really spacious bathroom but no bathtub even tho we stayed in a deluxe premiere.

Because of all Mt. Agung eruption fears going on with the tourists, a lot of flights were personally cancelled included some of people I know but not me and my friend. In fact, we found it a luck for us to find cheap hotels since most of the hotel rooms and villas aren't fully booked. And so we found your hotel. I am totally fine with the 'so-so' experience we received from the staff and includes of our hotel: the guard who checks our bags wasn't helpful in as simple as helping to open our bags to check since we didn't have enough hand to do it, after the reception handed our room key, we didn't know where to go as nobody assisted us until we seek for help, the room doesn't have slippers, bath robe and at least whiter towels. But the most horrifying experience I had was when I get back to Jakarta. I brought a mini beast bed bugs I am pretty sure I got from your hotel. It wasn't a pleasant experience at all and I definitely would never want anyone I know to experience the same. However, I wish your management to do something about this so I would be the last. I wish, to bring your pets to our homes.

The architecture itself is mesmerizing, the pool garden is superb, & the staff are nice. But the room we were in is considered small compared to other hotels we've ever been to with the same rate. The main problem is the air conditioner in our room. It was already on for several hours but it's doing nothing to the temperature. We were literally sweating in our room. We called the front office & they sent a technician to check the air-con. The technician did the checking twice at 1 am, could you imagine. He then said that there were some errors and it already got fixed, but we're still sweating an hour later (2 am). I called the front office again and finally asked to change my room. They upgraded our room to a better room with a working air-con, finally, but it was already 3 am. We didn't enjoy our stay at all & I decided to rent another room in another hotel for the next day, even though we already paid for 2 nights. My point is, they should've changed our room since the first time I called the front office and told them the air-con wasn't working. It was in the middle of the night & they had to send a technician to check the air-con? That was inappropriate & unprofessional. And the most disappointing part? They told me when I checked out that they already knew that there was a problem with the air-con in our room, but because the hotel was full so they had to put us in that room.

101877895,3000020015863,Verliana,5.1,"We booked a 3 nights stay in total at Llyods in Bali. We booked their Sky Room for 2 nights, while the 3rd night we booked their Suite Room directly via the Hotel website because I wanted to celebrate my fiance's birthday there. In all my life, this hotel gave me the worst experience. We do agree that the hotel is very Instagramable, and we took a lot of pictures there. But being instagrammable wasn't enough to satisfy us customers in the hospitality industry. Here are some of the bad experiences that we'd like to share: 1. Hotel was located in an alley. and that alley is really small and tight (only fits 1 car) 2. The parking lot is really small and bad. The valet team were also not really useful. We spent around 20 minutes just to go out from the parking lot alone. Oh, it was also dark, only one way street outside of the alley. If we missed the alley, we had to turn around or move backwards. 3. Sky Room reviews: - The floor is dusty (as if it's not mopped) - The AC leaked (Room 315) - The rooms are not soundproof 4. Suite Room - The service was extremely bad, they didn't transfer our luggage directly to the room after we left it at receptionist. we had to ask them to do it. No pro activity. - We already paid full upfront on the day we arrived (3 days before), I also reminded them about our special request to the receptionist, but they didn't place enough attention. they didn't even know at first that we had a special request. Until I reminded them on the day we moved. - On the day we were about to stay at the suite room, the receptionist told us that the private pool was in treatment and cannot be used!! - The private pool was green and filled with moss, and the hotel manager told us that due to high season and the suite room is always fully booked, they could not find the time to treat the pool (what a ridiculous excuse!) - They just offered us to pay half-price of the room, but finally we refused and asked them to transfer us to our previous room in Deluxe. - It took us around 2 hours to negotiate with them. What a waste of time, because they had to get decisions from their HQ. - We could not change to other suite rooms because this is the only suite room that they have, that has private swimming pool. That's all our story, wanna go back? No thank you.",Romantic Vacation

Back story my friend and I went swimming and got ‘masuk angin’ we cannot sleep until 1pm. So we decided to call the butler and asked for ‘minyak kayu putih’, they said that the hotel does not have it so they try to find someone who does! And gave us a free hot choco too to warm up our tummies, Shout out to Pak Budi Utama for the warm & extra mile gesture! The next day during breakfast, Pak Budi came up to us and asked for our condition, we know that he's very tired because he stayed up for the whole night shift, we feel grateful for that. After our activities, we went back to our room and the Butler gave us flower and a get well soon card!

The hotel staff mixing liquid soap to wash dishes to my chocolates milkshakes accidentally he said because his co-worker put dishwasher plastic bottle in the beverage maker without any name Label because GM Horison hotel seminyak Mrs. Dahlia Panjaitan has admitted mistakes that have been done her hotel staff restaurant Horison seminyak bali and also about the negligence of forgetting to give a name on plastic bottle dish laundry. I’m sadly disappointed to Mrs.dahlia panjaitan as GM Horison hotel seminyak had time who only given paper containing the action to people who exposed to toxins like me when I drink Chocolate milkshake from restaurant hotel. Finally she’s ( Hotel GM ) decided to send me to Siloam hospital in sunset road area. The hotel gave a deposit to the hospital for my inpatient room, medicines only for 2 days and for my blood test, stomach and other checks to confirms if there was no danger because when at the hotel restaurant I could Vomit all the times. I’m feeling sad and more disappointed when GM Horison hotel seminyak and also her hotel staff leaving me alone unaccompanied in the hospital even they also already know from me if all my families in Jakarta. The hotel also did not call the hospital to inquire about my condition until I finally decided not to stay overnight in the hospital and back to the hotel by taxi and paid myself in the hotel.  When I returned to the hotel also I felt the hotel staff’s acted like nothing happened. Some of the hotel staff asked me about my condition but very funny because Mrs.dahlia panjaitan as Hotel GM never met me or call to my hotel room to asked my condition since I’m back from hospital a few days ago after the incident until I finally said loudly asking about it to the some of the hotel staff’s and also I said to them if GM hotel do not have a brain because she’s only ask her staff hotel to ask about my condition every time I met them in restaurant area. After my reactions finally GM hotel meet me while I was sitting in the pool bar with new friend from Bali as grab driver who I know when I was ordered grab  Mrs.dahlia panjaitan ask my condition and we talked a lot. She’s met me again the next morning when I had breakfast with my other new friend from Jakarta also but Mrs.dahlia panjaitan not met me again when today ( 4 Of June 2018 ) I check out and because the trauma I also never ordered chocolates milkshakes to the hotel since I’m back and check out of the hotel.  My last advice to Mrs.Dahlia panjaitan as GM Horison hotel seminyak please be more professional and considerate to the local tourists who staying in Horison hotel seminyak bali and also more attention to make a name in the liquid bottle for laundry and the label name for liquid sugar so there will be no victim like me. One more to remind you if your hotel receptionist know very well if I did upgrade full payment my room to pool view when I check in on Sunday 27 Of May 2018 and you know also very well if I’m not asked the hotel anything about the incident.  Thanks for Horison Hotel seminyak bali which has ruined my holiday in Bali and for sure I will not stay in this hotel anymore and also after I back to the hotel from hospital if international tourists in the hotel doesn’t like me without reasons A.K.A they seems hate me but it’s ok because they don’t know the fact if I’m as the Horison Hotel seminyak bali victim and the hotel already acknowledges the mistakes they have made.",Shopping & Culinary

We had a room with a balcony, which was the main reason why we choose horison seminyak. You can just walk like 5-10mins to the double six beach. They have 10 sunbed at the beach, you can easily find the parasol, it's free. The neighborhood was good, definitely friendly for kids. The food was a total bomb!

Poor security behavior management I was driving my car through the basement parking, during inclining, the car was suddenly made a jolted stop and I could not restart despite how many times I tried. I was shocked as the thought something was wrong with the engine and quickly got out and checked around. Surprisingly, it was because an idle wooden wheel chock lying there. What’s more to it, the security ignorantly didn’t do anything. 2. Breaching of customer privacy right. My parents were staying next door within the connecting room. Once morning, I heard he screamed and shockingly yelled to someone. I stormed at the door and my dad angrily explained that a guy from housekeeping opened the door out of nowhere while my mother was at the shower. While it’s true, few minutes ago, he made a call for facial tissue and was at the toilet when the bell rang. 3. Ignorant manager on duty My parents tried to communicate the issues to their superior but instead of apologizing, assistant manager (MOD) named Adhi only said that it was miss communication. We left the hotel speechlessly thinking in what world it can be miss communication. That’s basic SOP that you need to make a call first to the room when customers do not respond after ringing the bell/knocking by the door.
